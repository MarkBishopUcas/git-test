Which of the following would both scientists agree on?
Question 1
Which of the following would both scientists agree on?

A
Eating dark chocolate can be good for your health.

B
Chocolate should be eaten in moderation.

C
There have been a lot of studies to support positive health effects from chocolate.

D
Eating chocolate may lower the risk of cancer.

The correct answer is (B).

Even Scientist 1, who argues that dark chocolate can be healthy for you, says that the "moderate intake of chocolate" is key. We're pretty sure Willy Wonka would beg to differ, but it's well documented that the original Wonka in Roald Dahl's novel was more than a little insane. Scientist 1 isn't arguing that chocolate is healthy, only that it has some health benefits.

Scientist 2 states that chocolate should not be seen as "healthy" (A), as not enough studies have proven its benefits (C). Neither scientist mentions cancer (D), and we're going to keep on hoping that the two aren't linked. 

Passage A
Passage I

Chocolate has been around since as early as 1100BC when ancient cultures like the Aztecs used it to make a bitter drink called xocolatl. Today, chocolate research is usually geared toward making the candy more flavorful, smoother, and, in the end, more profitable for the candy company. But, some scientists have argued that chocolate, beyond just being tasty, in fact carries with it numerous health benefits such as positive effects on the circulatory system, anticancer effects, and even brain stimulation. Other researchers, however, say that the bad effects outweigh the good. The following two scientists engage in a debate over the positive and negative health effects of chocolate.

Scientist 1

Numerous studies show that the moderate intake of chocolate—especially dark chocolate—has benefits to human health. For example, an increased intake of chocolate in rats has been shown to lower the level of inflammatory chemicals, thereby suppressing the symptoms of migraine headaches. Additionally, the daily consumption of dark chocolate, a food high in antioxidant compounds, may substantially lower blood pressure and may have a hand in lowering the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

Scientist 2

Some positive health effects of eating chocolate have been reported, but not enough research has been done to confirm any of them. Many of the recent studies with chocolate only use rats, or even test tubes, to link health effects to chocolate, but do not provide evidence that these effects will translate into humans. Moreover, it is well observed that excessive consumption of dark chocolate is directly linked to weight gain and obesity, which are factors in the cardiovascular diseases that dark chocolate supposedly treats. Chocolate may be a tasty treat, but it should not be prescribed as a healthy one.

Question 2
Which of the following was NOT mentioned by Scientist 1 as a potential health benefit of chocolate consumption?

F
Helping to treat migraine headaches

G
Lowing blood pressure

H
Increasing brain activity

J
Lowing the risk for cardiovascular disease

The correct answer is (H).

Chocolate doesn't increase increase brain activity? We've been telling people the exact opposite for years to justify our, to put it delicately, above average consumption of the good stuff. Need that report done a day early? That's a two-bar job. Work the weekend? At least a box. While Scientist 1 never actually says chocolate doesn't increase brain activity, we're taking the fact that he or she doesn't discount the theory directly as proof that the jury is still out, and that's all the excuse we need.

Scientist 1 knows what's up when it comes to chocolate. He or she knows that it can lower inflammatory symptoms, leading to migraine relief (F), and recognizes that chocolate is rich in antioxidants and can help lower blood pressure (G). Scientist 1 even mentions that chocolate can lower the risk for cardiovascular disease (J).

Question 3
Which of the following might begin to convince Scientist 2 that chocolate may have positive effects on human health?

A
More numerous and rigorous studies directly linking chocolate intake to specific positive health effects in humans

B
Personal experience that Scientist 2 feels better after eating a chocolate bar

C
A computer simulation showing that chocolate acts as an antioxidant in the body

D
A study financed and promoted by chocolate companies to make their product more appealing to health-conscious consumers

The correct answer is (A).

Scientist 2 is quick to point out that current studies use rats or test tubes and not human subjects. To remedy this disconnect, new studies should directly link health benefits with human consumption. If and when those studies are published, Scientist 2 would probably be happy to endorse chocolate. In fact, we bet Scientist 2 might even volunteer to personally take part in a study that involved eating lots of chocolate to see what happens. We know we would.

Like most scientists, Scientist 2 is all about the facts. Feeling out-of-this-world amazing after biting into a Ghirardelli chocolate bar won't sway his or her opinion (B). Computer simulations (C) won't do the trick, either; Scientist 2 needs to see the effects on a real human being. Tricking consumers with flashy marketing campaigns (D) are the opposite of what Scientist 2 wants to see.

Question 4
A new study is conducted that shows the intake of dark chocolate leads to an enhancement of MKP expression in the trigeminal ganglion and a decrease in the level of CGRP, an inflammatory chemical. Scientist 1 might argue this as proof that eating dark chocolate can:

F
enhance brain activity.

G
diminish the symptoms of migraines.

H
reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

J
increase the risk of obesity.

The correct answer is (G).

Fortunately, we're not expected to know what MKP, CGRP or trigeminal ganglion are to answer this question. Phew. Notice the keywords "inflammatory chemical" and "migraines." Both of these terms are used by Scientist 1 in his or her argument. Scan the paragraph for "inflammatory chemical," make the connection to "migraines," and voilà!

We could also solve this one via process of elimination. A quick revisit of the passage reminds us that Scientist 1 doesn't mention enhanced brain activity (F) or obesity (J) at all in his or her argument. Scientist 1 does say that chocolate might have a hand in lowering cardiovascular disease, but doesn't connect this to inflammatory chemicals (H).

Question 5
A largely inconclusive study is published stating that moderate consumption of dark chocolate may, but does not necessarily, act as an antioxidant in the human body, helping to fight free radicals. This study lends credence to the opinion of which scientist?

A
Scientist 1

B
Scientist 2

C
Neither scientist

D
Both scientists

The correct answer is (D).

Scientist 1 likes any study that suggests chocolate is healthy. We like those studies too. Scientist 1 would say that this new study, when combined with other studies, shows the beneficial effects of dark chocolate. While it may not be of the highest quality, the study supports other studies that are of high quality. The new study is hanging with the cool crowd, and that gives it instant credibility in the eyes of Scientist 1.

Remember Scientist 2, the skeptic? He or she would latch onto the fact that the study's findings were "inconclusive," and, much like all of the other studies out there, didn't provide enough evidence to support the claim that eating dark chocolate is healthy. We think Scientist 2 needs to relax with a nice cup of hot cocoa.

Question 6
Which of the following is NOT an argument used by Scientist 2 that eating chocolate probably does more harm than good?

F
The amount of studies done on the health benefits of chocolate is insufficient.

G
Eating chocolate is a known cause of weight gain and obesity.

H
Your risk of cardiovascular disease may be increased by eating too much chocolate.

J
Milk or white chocolate is less healthy than dark chocolate.

The correct answer is (J).

Scientist 1 says that dark chocolate is especially beneficial (as opposed to other kinds of chocolate), but Scientist 2 specifically mentions studies that say exactly the opposite, that dark chocolate creates problems rather than solving them. Scientist 2 never mentions white or milk chocolate by name, but there's not much of a chance he or she thinks they are worse than dark chocolate. If white and milk chocolate were more dangerous, we'd expect Scientist 2 to focus on that rather than on dark chocolate alone.

Scientist 2 argues that there haven't been enough studies showing the health benefits of chocolate to take the claim seriously (F), that eating chocolate causes weight gain (G), and that eating chocolate increases the chance of cardiovascular disease (H) to support his or her claim that eating dark chocolate isn't necessarily healthy and that it may in fact be more harmful to humans. Scientist 2 is clearly not considering the health of the soul, but whatever.

Question 7
Someone who shares the beliefs of Scientist 1 might support the claim that chocolate is healthy by stating that it is an antioxidant, which lowers the risk of disease. Clinical trials have shown, however, that antioxidants have no effect on the risk of disease. It turns out that health benefits from foods that happen to be high in antioxidant compounds (like fruits and vegetables) come from a complex mix of compounds, not antioxidants alone. The fact that antioxidants alone are not beneficial to one's health supports whose argument?

A
Scientist 1

B
Scientist 2

C
Neither scientist

D
Both scientists

The correct answer is (C).

Scientist 1 implies that the antioxidants in chocolate make it a healthy snack, but because antioxidants alone aren't necessarily beneficial, this argument sounds a bit like an attempt to capitalize on "healthy" buzz words and diminishes Scientist 1's credibility. Ouch. No one tell the POM Wonderful people. Scientist 2 doesn't even mention antioxidants, so this new fact neither hurts nor helps his or her argument.

Based on Figure 1, what is the best estimate of the sea surface temperature in July 2005?
Question 8
Based on Figure 1, what is the best estimate of the sea surface temperature in July 2005?

F
24.5 °C

G
25.2 °C

H
29.25 °C

J
35.0 °C

The correct answer is (H).

Sea surface temperature is represented at various points throughout 2004 and 2008 by the jagged green line in graph (a) of Figure 1. To find the correct answer, locate July 2005 on the x-axis and... Wait. There aren't any months on the x-axis. That's not good. However, because July falls at the halfway point in a year, it's a safe bet that it is represented by a point roughly halfway between 2005 and 2006. The green lines appear to peak at close to 30° C, making 29.5° C the best answer choice.

While it is difficult to find the temperature with 100% accuracy because of the limitations of the graph, 24.5­° C (F) and 25.2° C (G) are both much lower than the peak of the arc, and 35.0° C (D) is much higher, making 29.5° C the clear winner, even if it isn't exactly right.

Question 9
Given that sea surface temperature is the dependent variable, which of the following is the independent variable in Figure 1(a)?

A
Pathogenic microbe density

B
The date, in years

C
Beneficial microbe density

D
Glover's reef

The correct answer is (G).

This question gives away part of the answer when it says that the temperature is the dependent variable. In Figure 1(a), the vertical, or y-axis, is the sea surface temperature, while the horizontal, or x-axis, is the date (in years). The temperature varies depending on the time, which makes the date, in years, the independent variable. The temperature is dependent on time the way we're dependent on Mama Shmoop for delicious baked goods, at least until we finally learn her top-secret chocolate chip cookie recipe.

Pathogenic (F) and beneficial (H) microbe densities are also dependent variables, but they appear in Figure 1(b), not 1(a). Glover's Reef (J) is the location where the measurements were taken, making it a constant for the experiment rather than a variable.

Question 10
In Figure 1(b), what is the relationship between the pathogens and beneficials?

F
The pathogens and beneficials have a direct relationship.

G
The pathogens and beneficials have an exponential relationship.

H
There is no relationship between the beneficials and pathogens.

J
The pathogens and beneficials have an inverse relationship.

The correct answer is (J).

Finally, we're going going to talk about that dotted blue line. Keen observers have already noticed that it moves in almost exactly the same way as the solid red line, but everything the red line does, the blue dotted line does the opposite. When the red line goes up, the blue dotted line goes down. When the red line goes down, the blue dotted line goes up. When a change in one factor results in an opposite change in another factor, the two factors have an inverse relationship. 

If the pathogens and beneficials (F) had a direct relationship, they would both increase or both decrease at the same time, the opposite of what is going on here. Exponential relationships (G) have changing slopes, much like this graph, but they also change constantly rather than having brief periods of rapid increase and rapid decrease. The graph would be a lot more random and blob-like if there were no relationship between the pathogens and beneficials (H).

Using data from Figure 1(b), what is the scaled microbe density of pathogenic bacteria during winter of 2004?

A
0

B
0.2

C
0.4

D
0.8

The correct answer is (A).

In Figure 1(b), the pathogen's scaled microbe densities are represented by the red line, which stays at zero until its sudden spike halfway through 2005. Because the line is at zero for all of 2004, the answer wouldn't change even if the question asked for the summer of '04. The summer of '69 is, of course, a completely different story.

0.8 (D) is where the scaled microbe density peaks during the latter half of 2005, not 2004. Measurements of 0.2 (B) and 0.4 (C) both flew by somewhere near the midpoint of 2005 when pathogen densities skyrocketed to their peak of 0.8.

On average, what is the lowest sea surface temperature each year?
Question 12
On average, what is the lowest sea surface temperature each year?

F
24° C

G
26 °C

H
27.5 °C

J
29 °C

The correct answer is (G).

We're talking temperatures rather than microbe densities, so the answer comes from graph Figure 1(a). The green line representing actual temperature measurements is all over the place, making it difficult to estimate an average, but luckily, the graph has already done a lot of the work for us by providing a fitted line, the black dashed line that follows the general course of the green line. When there is no actual measurable relationship between a dependent and an independent variable, a fitted line presents a good, if not exact, description of that relationship. The dashed black line bottoms out at around 26° C every year, making it a the best estimate for the average low of the available choices.

If the correct answer isn't apparent from the graph, try eliminating some of the other answers first. For example, 24°C (F) is too low for an average because only one point in late 2004 gets close to touching it. 29°C (J) is near the peak high for each year, so it isn't a great candidate for the average low. 27.5° C (H) is closer to the actual average than either of the other incorrect answers, but a close look shows that 27.5° falls close to halfway up the curve each year rather than near the bottom.

B
The warm anomaly has no effect on the levels of beneficials and pathogens.

C
The repercussions of a warm anomaly on pathogen levels last longer than the warm anomaly itself.

The warm anomaly, which occurred about halfway between 2005 and 2006, is circled in Figure 1(a). In Figure 1(b), the warm anomaly is marked by two vertical dotted black lines. The fun little double-dutch between the pathogens and beneficials happens right after the height of the warm anomaly, meaning that the imbalance of the bacterial levels last longer than the period where the temperature is higher in Figure 1(a), meaning that the repercussions of the warm anomaly last much longer than the actual anomaly.  That, ladies and gents, is science.

The pathogen levels were actually highest after the warm anomaly (F), though they were still definitely affected by it (G). Sadly, beneficials didn't seem to benefit from the warm anomaly (J).

The worldwide decline in coral reefs is blamed in part on a change in the microorganisms that live within the coral cover. Resident microorganisms are replaced by pathogenic microbes, often Vibrio, which in turn increase the risk of coral disease and death. Figure 1(a) shows the changes in sea surface temperature in Glover's Reef. The dashed line represents the fitted line for seasonal variation. Each year is plotted such that January is the first data point collected. The peak temperatures occur during the summer. The circles in (a) represent warm anomalies.

Question 14
What is the overall range in sea surface temperature for Glover’s Reef from 2004 to 2008?

F
4°C

G
24°C

H
Almost 30°C

J
Between 5 and 6°C

The correct answer is (J).

Range is a math-y term that has to do with the difference between the lowest and highest values in a set of numbers. Since we're looking for the range in sea surface temperature for Glover's Reef, we're focusing on the first graph. At the highest of the anomalously high sea surface temps – those times when the reef is host to the bacteria that did not earn comments for "good citizenship" or "playing well with others" on their little report cards – the green line tells us that the temperature was at about 30°C. Looking for the lowest point on the graph, we see that the temp did dip down below 25, but not quite to 24°C in the winter. A little mental math tells us that 30 - 25 = 5, while 30 - 24 = 6, so the range is between 5 and 6 (J).

The range isn’t the high temp, or the low temp, but the difference between them, so 30°C (H), and 24°C (G) are not what we are looking for.

Question 15
The student wraps her copper wire several times around the iron nail. She then places the nail near some ferric metal to test its magnetism. What should she expect to see?

A
The nail will not be magnetic.

B
The nail will be weakly magnetic.

C
The nail will be strongly magnetic.

D
The nail will produce an electric field.

The correct answer is (A).

That was anti-climactic. All that wire wrapping, and the end result was nothing more than a somewhat elaborate metal-tapping device. The student forgot one key thing—she didn't connect the battery, the thing that puts "electro" into "electromagnet." Without a battery, there's no electric current flowing through the wire. Without the electric current, there's no electric field (D) and no magnetism, strong (C) or otherwise (B). Without magnetism, there;s no experiment. With no experiment, well, that's just not good...

Passage A
Passage III

Students are asked to perform an experiment whereby they create an electromagnet. An electromagnet is simply a magnet whose magnetic field has been produced by inducing an electric current onto it. Simple electromagnets, consisting of an iron core, copper wire, and a source of electric current, are used in all kinds of devices, from motors to MRI machines.

The students are given the following equipment.

A single iron nail
Some copper wire
Two D-cell batteries
Some ferric (iron-bearing) metal pieces
To make an electromagnet, the students are instructed to wrap the copper wire around the iron nail and then connect each end of the wire (shown below in gold) to either end of a battery. The more energy that the student can pass through the copper wire via multiple wire turns, the stronger the magnet will become. Magnets have two sides, a positively charged side and a negatively charged side. Each side attracts the opposite charge of a similar ferromagnetic material. The direction in which the student wraps his or her wire around the iron nail (clockwise or counter-clockwise) as well as which polarity of the battery (postive or negative) the wire is attached to will determine the direction in which the electrons will flow through the wire and, in turn, will determine which side of the nail becomes the positive and which becomes the negative part of the magnet. At the end of the exercise, the students are instructed to disconnect the copper wires from their batteries so as not to drain them.

Question 16
The student connects the nail to the D-cell battery by wrapping the ends of the copper wire around the positive and negative battery terminals. She then places the nail near some ferric metal to test its magnetism. What should she expect to see?

F
The nail will not be magnetic.

G
The nail will produce an electric field.

H
The nail will attract the ferric metal.

J
The ferric metal will become magnetic.

The correct answer is (H).

Now we're cooking with gas...er, batteries. Connecting the ends of the copper wire to the positive and negative terminals of a battery creates an electric current in the copper wire, which creates a magnetic field around the iron nail. By itself, the nail was not magnetic, but the directional movement of the electricity through the wires give it super powers. The ferric metal pieces, which like the nail before getting wrapped in electrified copper wire, are not magnetic, but they are still drawn to magnets, meaning that the newly-magnetized nail will attract them. If only only we could all gain super powers by wrapping ourselves in copper hooked up to electric current. Important side note: do not try something like that at home.

It is important to note that the nail isn't doing the work here. The copper wire and the battery are producing the magnetic field, not the nail (G), however the nail will be magnetic (F), even if it isn't the one putting in the work. The ferric metal is not magnetic at all (J). Rather, it is reacting to the magnetic field created by the copper wire and the battery.

Question 17
A second student, having wrapped his iron nail in copper wire, attaches the wire to TWO D-cell batteries instead of one. Will his electromagnet behave differently than the student who only attached one battery?

A
No, his electromagnet will be exactly the same.

B
Yes, the magnetism will be reduced because the student needs to use more copper wire to handle the increased in electric current.

C
Yes, the magnetism will be increased because of the increased flow of electric current.

D
No, the current will be increased, but the magnetism will remain the same.

The correct answer is (C).

The new magnet with two batteries will be stronger. The magnetism in the nail depends on the flow of current, which is provided by the battery, to produce its magnetic field. Increasing the flow of current by using a bigger battery or, say, by adding a second battery, increases the magnet's strength too. More current = more magnet. Before anyone gets any ideas about running off to the store for a whole cart full of copper wire and batteries, we don't think there is any way to conquer the world with an electromagnet. Trust us. We know a guy.

The magnetism definitely won't stay the same (D), or worse, decrease (B), by adding a second battery.

Question 18
With the use of a permanent magnet that has its positive and negative poles labeled, how might the student determine which side of his magnet is the positive and which is the negative pole?

F
Check which side of the electromagnet is repelled by the positive pole of the permanent magnet. Label this side the positive pole.

G
Check which side of the electromagnet is attracted to the positive pole of the permanent magnet. Label this side the positive pole.

H
Check which side of the electromagnet is stronger. Label this side the negative pole.

J
Check which side of the electromagnet is stronger. Label this side the positive pole.

The correct answer is (F).

The old saying for dating and relationships is the same as the tried and true rule for magnets: opposites attract. While we would expect to see a lot more weird couples out and about if the dating rule was actually true, there's no wiggle room for magnets. The positive end of a magnet always attracts a negative end and repels another positive end. The negative end of a magnet always attracts a positive end and repels another negative end. If one side of the electromagnet creation is repelled by the clearly labeled positive side of the magnet that the teacher handed out, then it's time to write a big plus sign on that side of the electromagnet.

Neither the positive nor negative side of the electromagnet will be stronger (H), (J). They'll both have the same strength because they are both part of the same magnet with the same power source.

Question 19
A third student leaves his electromagnet fully assembled overnight. When he returns the next day, his magnet no longer attracts his ferric metal. Why might this be?

A
Electromagnets, unlike permanent magnets, have a very short lifespan.

B
The ferric metal became demagnetized because it sat in the electromagnet's magnetic field for so long.

C
All of the power in the battery was used up overnight.

D
None of the above.

The correct answer is (C).

Unless it's been graced by the powers of the Energizer Bunny, a battery only lasts for so long. Much like we have to charge our iPhone every once in a while (read: every few hours), single-cell batteries like AA, AAA, and D also die and need to be recharged or replaced. Even though a nail wrapped in copper wire appears to be sitting there and not doing anything with a noticeable lack of touch screen interfaces, electricity is still leaving the battery, draining its power reserves slowly but surely.

An electromagnet lasts as long as the current continues to flow (A), and ferric metal won't ever become demagnetized (B). To do that, we'd have to strip the Fe atoms clean out of it, which would make it a non-ferric metal.

Question 20
The first student incorrectly labeled her electromagnet's poles. She drew a '+' on the negative pole and a '–' on the positive pole. How can she switch the polarity of her magnet so that the labels are correct?

F
She should unwrap the copper wire and re-wrap it around the nail, but in the opposite direction.

G
She should switch end of the wire is connected to the positive and negative terminals of her battery.

H
Both F and G.

J
Either F or G.

The correct answer is (J).

There are two things that control which way the electric field will flow through the student's electromagnet: the direction in which the copper wire is wrapped around the nail and the way that the student connected the wires to the battery.

Because the south sand north poles of a magnet are defined by the direction that the electric field is flowing, these two things also determine which side of the magnet is positive and which is negative. Switching the wire wrapping changes the polarity (F), and switching the battery changes the polarity (G). If the student were to switch the wires and the battery, however, the polarity would be the same as before any changes were made.

Question 21
Suppose Student A wrapped the copper wire around his nail 10 times, while Student B wrapped her copper wire around her nail 12 times, and Student C wrapped his copper wire around his nail 15 times.

A
Student A

B
Student B

C
Student C

D
The amount of times the wire is wrapped will not affect the electromagnet.

The correct answer is (C).

The key to this question is finding the important sentence in the passage that reads: "The more energy that the student can pass through the copper wire via multiple wire turns, the stronger the magnet will become." This tells us that the more times the wire is wrapped around the nail, the more powerful the electromagnet will become. Once we know that, it is just a matter of determining which student wrapped wire around the most times. Yahtzee! Student C (C) wrapped it 15 times.

Student A (A) and Student B (B) both wrapped their wires around their nails less than 15 times, which indicates that their electromagnet will be less powerful, since more turns of wire means a more powerful electromagnet.

Question 22
Which of the rock layers in Figure 1 must be the oldest?

F
Layer A

G
Layer C

H
Layer D

J
Layer E

The correct answer is (H).

When looking at layers of rocks, it's a safe bet that 99% of the time, the rock that is on the bottom is the oldest. Think of it this way: If C were somehow deposited before D, it would have to hover in the air until D could be magically deposited beneath it. Scientists generally don't call things "laws" unless they are really, really sure about something, so the fact that the basic principle that rocks get older the deeper in the group they are found is called the law of superposition means that it's more than a suggestion.

With that in mind, there's no way Layers A (F) or C (G) are the oldest. As for Layer E (J)? It's all the way at the surface! Nice try, E, but we all know D is older and wiser. 

Passage A
Passage IV

A team of scientists is studying a group of rock formations in the Gobi Desert. While hiking through a canyon, the team spots a section of canyon wall that contains all five of the rock formations that make up the area (Figure 1). The rock formations have been bisected by a fault that is dipping about 45° to the north.

The relative ages of rocks (which layer is older than which) can be determined by observing the placement of each layer relative to one another in the field. Rocks are deposited horizontally and sequentially over time, so the oldest rock in a stack of layers is typically at the greatest depth.

To determine the absolute age of a rock, scientists must bring samples back to the lab and analyze them using radiometric dating techniques. Radiometric dating works by measuring the concentrations of a radioactive "parent" element and its radioactive decay product, or "daughter product." The team of scientists used K-Ar dating to determine the absolute ages of the rocks in Figure 1. The Potassium-40 (K40) parent decays into Argon-40 (Ar40) daughter. It takes 1.25 billion years for 50% of the Potassium-40 in any rock to decay into Argon-40; this is K40's half-life. For example, it would take 1.25 billion years for 100 mol of K40 to become 50 mol of K40 plus 50 mol of Ar40.

To date a rock, one assumes that no daughter product was present when the rock formed. Any daughter product measured in the rock during analysis is therefore a product of radioactive decay of the parent.

Question 23
The scientists want to know about how the fault affected the area. Specifically, they want to know the direction in which the surrounding rocks were displaced when the faulting occurred.

A
Strike-slip fault

B
Normal fault

C
Reverse fault

D
None of the above

The correct answer is (C).

Notice that layers B, C, and D in Figure 1 are higher on the right than on the left. Jump down to Figure 2 and compare this orientation to the three types of faults pictured. The "Reverse Fault" also shows rock layers that are higher on the right than on the left. We once tried to argue with Mama Shmoop that the presence of a reverse fault mean that she was actually to blame for the broken vase rather than us. That argument didn't end well for us.

In a "Normal Fault," (B) the right side is lower. (Why do geologists get to decide what's normal, anyway?) In a "Strike-slip Fault," (A) both sides are the same height; the rocks are only displaced horizontally.

H

J

The correct answer is (J).

To figure out the age of the fault, ask Layer E! Layer E is the youngest layer, so it has the sharpest memory. It's also smack dab in the middle of the fault. Think of the layers like they're names on a suspect list. It's always best to start with someone who was at the scene of the crime, right? CSI: Miami, we thank you.

We're talking about the fault here, not the entire layered cake. Layers A (F), B (G), C (H), and D were all displaced by the fault, meaning they had to have been there for the fault to cut through them. Their ages will only tell us when those layers formed. A million (or a billion) years may have passed between Layer A being deposited and the fault occurring.

1.25 Billion years

B
0.625 Billion years

C
2.5 Billion years

D
5 Billion years

The correct answer is (B).

The sample from Layer C started life with 100 mol of K40 (that's 75 + 25). In 1.25 billion years, 50 mol would have decayed and we'd be left with 50 mol K40 and 50 mol Ar40. If it takes 1.25 billion years to decay 50 mol, it takes half that time (0.625 billion years) to decay 25 mol (half that amount). Thankfully, this isn't a math exam, so there's no need (or space) to show the work. Geology: the only science where you can divide billions in your head. That would make for quite the rebranding campaign in the course catalog.

Passage A
Passage IV

A team of scientists is studying a group of rock formations in the Gobi Desert. While hiking through a canyon, the team spots a section of canyon wall that contains all five of the rock formations that make up the area (Figure 1). The rock formations have been bisected by a fault that is dipping about 45° to the north.

The relative ages of rocks (which layer is older than which) can be determined by observing the placement of each layer relative to one another in the field. Rocks are deposited horizontally and sequentially over time, so the oldest rock in a stack of layers is typically at the greatest depth.

To determine the absolute age of a rock, scientists must bring samples back to the lab and analyze them using radiometric dating techniques. Radiometric dating works by measuring the concentrations of a radioactive "parent" element and its radioactive decay product, or "daughter product." The team of scientists used K-Ar dating to determine the absolute ages of the rocks in Figure 1. The Potassium-40 (K40) parent decays into Argon-40 (Ar40) daughter. It takes 1.25 billion years for 50% of the Potassium-40 in any rock to decay into Argon-40; this is K40's half-life. For example, it would take 1.25 billion years for 100 mol of K40 to become 50 mol of K40 plus 50 mol of Ar40.

To date a rock, one assumes that no daughter product was present when the rock formed. Any daughter product measured in the rock during analysis is therefore a product of radioactive decay of the parent.

Question 26

F
1.25 Billion years

G
0.625 Billion years

H
2.5 Billion years

J
5 Billion years

The correct answer is (F).

The passage states that the half-life of K40 is 1.25 billion years. That means it takes 1.25 billion years for one-half of the K40 initially in the rock to decay, creating Ar40. In the question, there are equal amounts of K40 and Ar40 in the sample, which means that half of the original amount of K40 has decayed into Ar40. We know the relative amounts of the elements. We know the length of a half-life. That makes this answer a slam dunk: 1.25 billion years.

Question 27
The scientists know that the canyon they are standing in was cut by an ancient river. Based on the information the scientists have from Figure 1, what observations could they make to determine in which direction the river was flowing?

A
Determine radiometric age dates for all of the rock layers.

B
Measure the angle of the fault and determine what kind of fault it is.

C
Observe each rock layer and look for fish fossils.

D
Observe the local topography and determine the downslope direction.

The correct answer is (D).

Don't make this question harder than it actually is. Topography determines which direction a river flows. Gravity likes to pull things downhill. If the current surface topography makes it clear which way is downhill, and assuming that that direction has always been downhill for the area according to the observed geological layers, then the direction that the ancient river flowed can be determined without looking at anything else.

Fish fossils (C) won't be helpful, unless scientists are trying to figure out what type of fillets were served up way back when. Determining how old the rock layers (A) are is unnecessary in this case, though we know how fond geologists are of determining the age of everything in site. Knowing the type of fault (B) is great as well, but it really isn't helpful information. Kind of like knowing how to write in cursive (or so some people seem to think anymore).

Question 28
As indicated by Figure 2, fault lines can be characterized by the direction of slip. A fault line's sense of slip is defined according to the motion of the rock layers on each side of the fault, relative to one another. If scientists were to classify a fault as strike-slip, what type of movement did they likely discover between the rock layers on either side of the fault, relative to one another?

F
Vertical

G
Horizontal

H
Compression

J
Spreading

The correct answer is (G).

Like the way little crabs crawl in side-to-side patterns on the beach, horizontal movement is characterized by lateral movement. Judging by the illustration of the strike-slip fault in Figure 2, the only movement indicated is side to side, or horizontal (G). We know this because both sides of the rock stay level relative to each other, meaning they do not move up and down.

The exact opposite of horizontal is vertical (F) which would indicate up-and-down movement. Vertical motion may be a viable way for faults to move, but then we would have to characterize the faults as either a normal or reverse fault, rather than a strike-slip. Compression (H) would describe rocks pushing together and spreading (J) would describe rocks moving apart from one another.

Question 29
The peak of a spectrum's curve indicates at what wavelength most of the energy in that object is emitted. In what part of the electromagnetic spectrum does an incandescent bulb emit most of its energy?

A
Ultraviolet (UV)

B
Visible

C
Infrared

D
Microwave

The correct answer is (C).

The peak of a spectrum's curve indicates where the majority of the energy is emitted. Looking at the graph, both the blue curve (typical sunlight) and the green curve (fluorescent light) have definite peaks in the visible spectrum. The red curve, representing the light emitted by an incandescent bulb, is much flatter without an obvious peak, but the curve is noticeably still moving up as it exits the visible spectrum, meaning that the peak must be in the infrared. While it is more correct to say that infrared it to the right of the visible spectrum in this graph, we prefer to think of it as over the rainbow.

Ultraviolet light (A) is below the visible spectrum, and the red curve indicates that incandescent bulbs emit virtually no UV light. Don't think too hard bout the fact that the majority of energy emitted by incandescent bulbs is beyond the visible spectrum (B) and in the infrared/heat range because that means turning on the lights in a room (back before the proliferation of compact fluorescent bulbs) was actually better for heating the room than lighting it. Microwave radiation (D) isn't even pictured on this graph, but if it were, it would be well to the left of UV light, far from the range of any of the light sources in the graph.

A student notices that the incandescent light bulbs in her home become very hot when turned on for a long time. Because heat can be measured as infrared radiation, the student decides to measure the spectra of different light bulb types in order to see how much infrared radiation they emit to test if incandescent bulbs emit more in the infrared than compact fluorescent bulbs.

By taking a measurement of the bulbs' spectra, or the intensity of radiation given off at different wavelengths, the student can directly observe how much of the bulbs' energy is being output as heat (infrared) and how much as visible light. Several spectra were measured and are shown in the graph below. The blue curve is typical light from the sun. The red curve is the light emitted from an incandescent bulb, and the green is light emitted from a compact fluorescent bulb.

Incandescent light bulbs give off more heat than fluorescent bulbs.

G
Incandescent light bulbs emit more infrared radiation than fluorescent bulbs.

H
The black area on the graph shows light emitted by a fluorescent bulb.

J
Heat energy is emitted as infrared light.

The correct answer is (G).

At no point in the passage does the student stand on a soapbox and proclaim, "This is my hypothesis!" For anyone who has ever taken part in a school science fair, this might seem a little odd. In the scientific method, hypotheses are usually explicit statements that predict the outcome of an experiment based on research or more casual observation. This students hypothesis is implicit rather than explicit. First, she notices that incandescent bulbs get extremely hot when in use for a long time. Then she decides to measure and compare the infrared radiation emitted by incandescent and compact fluorescent bulbs. Because this is stated as "to test if incandescent light bulbs emit more in the infrared than compact fluorescent bulbs," the student's hypothesis going in must have been that incandescent light bulbs do emit more infrared light than compact fluorescent bulbs.

That incandescent light bulbs emit more heat than fluorescent light bulbs (F) is a observation, not a hypothesis. Likewise, it is a known fact rather than a hypothesis that heat energy and infrared light are the same thing (J). While there is a black area along the base of the graph (H), it is never mentioned in the passage specifically.

Question 31
One of the chemicals in the fluorescent bulb emits light most strongly at a wavelength of 0.45 microns. What color would a light bulb glow if it contained only this chemical?

A
Violet

B
Green

C
Red

D
Infrared

The correct answer is (A).

Look on the x-axis of the graph. The light in question has a wavelength of 0.45 microns. A micron, also known as a micrometer, is a unit of measure equal to one one millionth of a meter, or the width of a single cell. On the graph, 0.45 microns is firmly in the purple-to-blue range of the visible spectrum. Blue doesn't appear in the answer choices, so purple is the best choice.

To be on the safe side, go back and check the other answer options. Green (B) is emitted at about 0.6 microns, and red (C) is emitted at about 0.75 microns. Infrared (D) is emitted above 0.75 microns so it looks like violet's the clear winner.

Question 32
Given all of the information in the passage and in the graph about the energy emitted by fluorescent and incandescent light bulbs, which kind of bulb would be more efficient at brightening a room?

F
An incandescent bulb

G
A fluorescent bulb

H
Neither bulbs will brighten a room efficiently

J
Both bulbs will have the same efficiency

The correct answer is (B).

The green curve, representing the spectrum of light emitting by the fluorescent light, falls mostly in the visible spectrum. It tails off for quite a while in the infrared spectrum, but the majority of the emitted energy is still visible rather than heat energy. The red curve, representing an incandescent bulb, is skewed more towards infrared and away from the visible spectrum. Watt per watt, energy is used more efficiently to light a room when it is pumped into a compact fluorescent bulb (G) than an incandescent bulb (F). If the room is both dark and cold, however, an incandescent bulb would be able to accomplish two tasks at once, though we think a space heater would probably be more efficient at heating a room than a table lamp.

Question 33
The spectrum of the fluorescent bulb is irregular due to certain chemicals within the bulb. In what part of the electromagnetic spectrum does the fluorescent bulb emit the most energy?

A
Ultraviolet (UV)

B
Visible

C
Infrared

D
Microwave

The correct answer is (B).

What? There are chemicals in our lightbulbs, too? That's it: We're officially moving to Canada. Notice that almost the entire green curve, which represents the fluorescent bulb, lies within the rainbow region on the graph. This is the region where visible light is emitted and where leprechauns frolic gleefully around their pots of gold. We suspect that scientists who study the spectrum of visible light found all of the leprechauns and their gold years ago but never told anyone about it, which explains why so many scientists drive Mazeratis (they don't).

Fluorescent light dips its toes into the UV range of light, but it definitely does peak there (A), and while fluorescent light spends quite a bit of time in the infrared spectrum (C) as well, it definitely does not peak there. Don't try to make a bag of popcorn with a fluorescent bulb, though. They don't emit any microwave radiation (D).

Question 34
When the student increases the flow of electricity into the fluorescent bulb, it becomes brighter, but its temperature only increases a small amount. Based on the graph, what will happen if she increases the flow of electricity into the incandescent bulb?

F
The incandescent bulb will react in same manner as the fluorescent bulb.

G
The incandescent bulb will become much hotter, but its brightness will not increase.

H
The incandescent bulb will become much hotter, and it will become brighter.

J
The incandescent bulb will become slightly brighter, but its temperature will stay the same.

The correct answer is (H).

The fluorescent bulb becomes brighter when the flow of electricity is increased, but its temperature does not change drastically because a fluorescent bulb does not emit much infrared radiation (a.k.a. heat) relative to how much visible light it emits. However, the incandescent bulb emits most of its energy in the infrared, so while increasing the electricity will increase its brightness slightly (more visible radiation), its temperature (infrared) will increase more dramatically. Even if the answer isn't entirely apparent from the graph alone, the introductory passage has some additional information to help form this hypothesis.

As the incandescent and fluorescent bulbs emit different spectra, they will not react in the same manner when the energy is increased (F). The incandescent bulb will definitely get at least somewhat brighter while getting much hotter according to the curve on the graph (G), (J).

Question 35
In Figure 1, Graph B, what is indicated by the peaks just after 9:30, at 10:00, and at around 10:25?

A
An increase in capture of prey for the seals.

B
An increase in the foraging intensity of the seals.

C
The amount of light during intense bioluminescence events

D
Seals reaching the surface of the water

The correct answer is (D).

While the question directs your attention to Graph B, you'll need to use a combination of information from both Graph B and Graph A to work through this problem. Graph B tells us that there's a lot of light just after 9:30, at 10:00, and just before 10:30. It doesn't tell us what kind of light we're dealing with. Are these bioluminescence events or did the seals bump into an underwater scuba diver disco party? We can't tell from Graph B alone.

Graph A tells us that at the same time the seals encountered a lot of light, they were at 0 meters of depth. In other words, they were at or near the surface of the water, and they likely were encountering sunlight at these times. (Or maybe there was a disco party at sea level.)

Bioluminescence events (C) are indicated only in Graph B by very small increases in the amount of light when the seals are deep below sea level. Since the scientists discovered that the seals' foraging intensity (B) is positively correlated with the number of biolumniscence events, we can infer that the seals' foraging intensity increased only when the seals were deep below sea level. Meanwhile, we aren't given enough information to know when the seals are actually successful at capturing their prey (A).

Passage VI

Marine predators that dive deep to hunt for food must be specially adapted to locate prey in the dark regions of the ocean, where little to no sunlight penetrates. Many species utilize echolocation, but scientists have been unable to explain how some animals, like the deeply diving southern elephant seals, forage in the dark without this skill.

A recent study found that southern elephant seals have vision with a peak sensitivity at 485 nm, the exact wavelength at which some organisms produce bioluminescence. By attaching light sensors to some elephant seals, scientists observed that the seals would selectively forage for bioluminescent organisms in the deep ocean. The study concluded that foraging activity of southern elephant seals is related to bioluminescence of their prey, as the foraging intensity of the seals was positively correlated to the number of bioluminescence events detected.

Question 36
During this study, when an increase in the number of bioluminescence events was detected, how did the foraging intensity of the seals change?

F
Foraging intensity increased.

G
Foraging intensity decreased.

H
Foraging intensity was unchanged.

J
It is unknown how the foraging intensity changed.

The correct answer is (F).

To answer this question, look no further than the passage. The last sentence in the third paragraph is the only place where "foraging intensity" is mentioned. According to the paragraph, foraging intensity is "positively correlated" to the number of bioluminescence events. A positive correlation is a relationship between two variables where if one goes up, the other goes up. If one goes down, the other goes down too. Because foraging intensity and bioluminescence events have a positive correlation, foraging intensity must have gone up during increased bioluminescence events. This makes sense; who likes eating in the dark, anyway?

At what time did the first dive begin?

A
9:00

B

C

D

The correct answer is (A).

Looking at the depth graph (the first one), the seal dives deep, searches for a while, and then comes up to a shallower level four times in a row. The first time that the seal begins to go deeper is at the beginning of the graph, or at about 9:00 as indicated by the x-axis. 9:00 isn't labeled on the x-axis, but the spacing of 9:30, 10:00, and 10:30 indicates that 9:00 is near the beginning of the x-axis and was probably dropped as a label to make room for the dotted line leading to the enlarged portion of the graph displayed below, at least on Graph B. Why 9:00 isn't labeled on Graph A isn't clear, but it might have something to do with the fact that the researcher who made the graph wasn't told it would be used on an ACT question.

While the seal does dive at around 9:30 (B), 10:00 (C), and 10:30 (D) as well, none of those are the first dive of the series.

Check out the bottom of the light graph, which is the time when the seal is also at the bottom of the ocean, and look for spikes in light. Whenever an organism glows during a seal dive, the seal's light sensors pick up that glow as an increase in light. The first dive shows two distinct spikes in the light detected during the deepest part of the seal's dive.

Don't be fooled by the very large peaks in light detected at around 9:30, 10:00, and just before 10:30, which occurred at the same time that the seal was very near to the surface. These spikes are sunlight coming from the surface and not bioluminescence events.

Marine predators that dive deep to hunt for food must be specially adapted to locate prey in the dark regions of the ocean, where little to no sunlight penetrates. Many species utilize echolocation, but scientists have been unable to explain how some animals, like the deeply diving southern elephant seals, forage in the dark without this skill.

A recent study found that southern elephant seals have vision with a peak sensitivity at 485 nm, the exact wavelength at which some organisms produce bioluminescence. By attaching light sensors to some elephant seals, scientists observed that the seals would selectively forage for bioluminescent organisms in the deep ocean. The study concluded that foraging activity of southern elephant seals is related to bioluminescence of their prey, as the foraging intensity of the seals was positively correlated to the number of bioluminescence events detected.

The figure below shows the light detected by the light sensors during 4 consecutive dives. Graph A shows the depth of each dive, and graph B shows the light detected during each of those dives.

Question 39
Sometimes a diving seal might not find any prey, and no bioluminescence events would be registered on the light sensors. How might this data be useful in the research study?

A
This data could be used to form a new hypothesis.

B
This data could be used as a control group for the experiment.

C
This data would provide additional insight into how seals react to bioluminescence.

D
This data would not be useful to researchers.

The correct answer is (B).

To prove that glowing organisms cause elephant seals to hunt more vigorously, we need data showing what a seal does when it sees glowing organisms. However, it would also be nice to have data on what seals do when they don't see glowing organisms. Without the control data, there is no positive correlation between dives and bioluminescence events. The seals might be diving equally as often when no bioluminescence events are occurring. Their chances of finding food when it is completely dark underwater seem like they would be much lower, but what else does a seal have to do all day? Fighting with each other has to get old at some point.

The hypothesis would not be changed by this data (A). Rather, it could be proven, making this additional data highly useful (D). Since this new data occurs when a seal doesn't observe any bioluminescence, it wouldn't provide any insight into what happens when they do observe it (C).

Question 40
What is the best reason for why the research methods used in this study would not work well to study the hunting patterns of the Weddell Seal, whose vision is not very sensitive at a wavelength of 485 nm?

F
The light sensors used in the elephant seal study would not be able to pick up any bioluminescence events in a Weddell Seal study.

G
Weddell Seals' diving activity is not as predictable as elephant seals.

H
Weddell Seals would not be able to see bioluminescence events.

J
Weddell Seals use echolocation to find prey.

The correct answer is (H).

This study was conducted on southern elephant seals because of their unique bioluminescent-sensitive vision. Their eyes are very sensitive to light at a wavelength of 485 nm, and their prey (bioluminescent organisms) glow at that exact wavelength. Because Weddell seals don't see this kind of light very well, it is a good guess it does not influence their behavior. Weddell seals are much cuter than elephant seals, which we think more than makes up for the fact that they can't see 485 nm light very well.

There is no reason why the light sensors used in the elephant seal study would not work in another study (F), and Weddell seals (G) are just as predictable—there's data to prove it!
