The correct answer is (B).

Dependent clauses, like children, need their parents (a.k.a. independent clauses) to survive and thrive in this mad world. Unlike children, however, dependent clauses aren't tax write offs—though that could change if the next election cycle goes the way we hope. When a sentence starts with a dependent clause, use a comma to mark the spot where the dependent clause ends and the independent clause begins. 

As is, the sentence sounds rushed and confusing (A). That dependent clause may be itching to cut out on its own, but because it isn't a complete sentence, it can't be set off by a semicolon (C) or a period (D).

The Insidious Bark Beetle

Once a (1) great, towering tree the ponderosa pine I had known all my childhood lay in a heap outside of my house. The tree's needle-like leaves, which usually remained green all year, had turned a rusty brown, signaling the tree's death. The dry, dead needles presented a fire (2) hazard, my family had no choice but to chop it down. Although the tree was more than two hundred feet high—the tallest on my family's property—it was killed by a creature no bigger than my (3) fingertip, the bark beetle.

[1] The insect attacks trees by burrowing under the bark, (4) lay eggs, and introduce a fungus that halts the tree's sap production. [2] As a result, infected trees struggle to manage and transport their life-giving nutrients, and wooded areas with bark beetle infestations soon turn into graveyards of red and gray trees. [3] The mountain pine beetle, one of the many species of bark beetle, (5) spread through forests in droves, wreaking havoc on tree populations. [4] Causing further damage, (6) the tree's precious cambium layer is fed on by the freshly hatched beetle larvae. (7)

For decades, bark beetles have ravaged forests along the west side of North America, destroying millions of acres of trees from New Mexico all the way to Canada. People in these areas (8) have responded to the catastrophe by cutting down the dead trees, which they believe increase the risk of wildfires. Some (9) scientists however say otherwise. They point to evidence that shows that beetle infestations actually lower fire (10) danger. By causing pine trees to shed the needles that fuel forest fires.

While the insects (11) really mess up forests, they may not be the only ones to blame for the crisis. Foresters and researchers explain that other factors contribute to tree mortality, such as mild winters and periods of drought. (12) Nevertheless, one scientist, biologist Reese Halter, does not blame the beetle at all. Instead, he attributes the problem to climate change and global warming, which lead to shorter winters and drier summers. Faced with these harsh conditions, trees become weaker. The bark beetles, sensing the trees' weakness, zero in on their vulnerable targets. (13)

The correct answer is (J)

Fancy meeting you here, dreaded comma splice. Though there are two complete sentences here, the author forces them together with just a comma. Fortunately, there are multiple fixes: The comma could be replaced with a period, and if "my" were capitalized, we'd be left with two perfectly perfect sentences. A semicolon in place of the comma would also do the trick. However, these two sentences are pretty interrelated, showing direct causation between one event and another. A comma/conjunction pairing that shows the causal link (", so") is the Shmoop-approved choice here.

Ever run into another person at full speed? That's basically what happens when these poor independent clauses smash together in a run-on sentence (G). A comma splice isn't any better because it still needs a conjunction to create a little cushion for the two clauses (F). Finally, "and for this reason" isn't necessarily wrong, but it's definitely too wordy (H).

The correct answer is (C).

Ah, the colon. Not only is it an important bodily organ, it's also (arguably) the most intimidating piece of punctuation in existence. When they aren't busy introducing lists, colons can be used to add emphasis to a word or phrase at the end of a sentence, as in the dramatic reveal of what killed the beloved ponderosa pine. 

Unless "fingertip" is a cute nickname for a spunky little bark beetle—which seems unlikely—simply using (A) or losing (B) the comma must be incorrect. Besides, the name would have to be capitalized if this were the case, as in: "Fingertip, the bark beetle, could be seen clearing forests ones tree at a time." Unlike colons, semicolons can only be used to connect two independent clauses (D).

Ahem. Pardon us. When listing things, all items in the list must take the same form (i.e. burrowing, laying, introducing). This consistency is known as parallel structure. 

As is, the list isn't parallel (F). Saying that bark beetles attack trees by "bark burrowing, egg laying, fungus introducing, and karate chopping," may be consistent, but it sounds awkward and strays from the formal tone of the passage (G). Finally, "lays eggs, and introduces a fungus" (H) may sound consistent within the answer choice, but it doesn't line up with the first verb in the sentence, "burrowing."

spread
Question 5
spread

A
NO CHANGE

B
spreads

C
spreading

D
will spread

The correct answer is (B).

What we have here is a classic case of subject-verb disagreement. Because the subject, the "mountain pine beetle," is singular, the verb should be singular, too. Say it to yourself: "the beetle spread"? Nah, "the beetle spreads" is the only answer that agrees in number with "beetle" and maintains the paragraph's present tense.

Leaving the sentence as is (A) keeps a plural verb with a singular subject, which we've determined is a major no-no. "Spreading" (C) and "will spread" (D) could've worked in another context, perhaps, but they don't follow the tense pattern of the passage.

H
the freshly hatched beetle larvae feeds on the tree's precious cambium layer

J
the freshly hatched beetle larvae feed on the tree's precious cambium layer

The correct answer is (J).

The passive voice is boring, excessively wordy, and often unnecessary. In the underlined sentence, the subject should be the beetle larvae—they're the ones doing all the work with the hatching and eating and all that. We feel bad for the cambium layer, but it's the thing being eaten, so it comes after the eater if we're putting the entire sentence in the active voice. 

If only the trees ate the beetles, then the forests could save themselves (G). "Feeds" is so, so close to being correct, but it treats "beetle larvae" as a singular noun (H).

Take Coldplay's advice on this one, and Don't Panic. Start by summing up the main point of each sentence, then look for transitional phrases that suggest a logical flow. Sentence 3 is a general statement, signaling to the reader that the paragraph will be about damage caused by the beetle, so it should come first. Sentence 1 provides details about how the beetle harms forests, and Sentence 4 links to that idea and builds on it with the logical connector "Causing further damage." Finally, Sentence 2 concludes the paragraph by telling what happens "As a result."

The correct answer is (F).

This sentence is talking about an action that occurred at an unspecified time in the past. The verb tense for this particular situation is referred to as the "present perfect," which is a little confusing because the action occurred in the past. The "present" part comes in because the tense doesn't make it clear whether the action is contained entirely within the past or if it continues in the present—like the people cutting down trees in the sentence. The present perfect tense is formed using the verb "have" and the past participle of the verb. This sentence already has that correct and would like to be left alone, thank you very much.

"Respond" shouldn't follow the present tense (H) or future tense (J), nor should the subject and verb disagree in number, as they do in "has responded" (G).

This question could drive us comma crazy, but we won't let it. Because "however" acts as extra, unnecessary information in the sentence—a.k.a. a nonrestrictive clause—it needs a comma on both sides.

Some sentences are really needy. In fact, they're so needy that they require more information to be considered a sentence at all. We call these "sentences" fragments, and we fix them by joining them with an independent clause. Because the dependent clause "by causing pine trees to shed the needles that fuel forest fires" comes after the independent clause and modifies the verb "lower," the two phrases must be connected without any punctuation.

Don't leave the fragments as fragments (F) or try to fix the problem by subbing in other punctuation marks for the period (G), (J). We were serious when we said no punctuation was necessary.

In this case, the passage has a formal tone, which means that informal phrases such as "mess up" don't belong. "Inflict obvious damage on" is the best alternative because of its succinct, formal style.

Leaving the passage untouched (A) or changing "really" to "without a doubt" (B) still retains that less-than-formal phrase "mess up," which we want to drop. "Clear and obvious" gets the style right, but it's also redundant (C). 

Passage A
Passage I

The Insidious Bark Beetle

Once a (1) great, towering tree the ponderosa pine I had known all my childhood lay in a heap outside of my house. The tree's needle-like leaves, which usually remained green all year, had turned a rusty brown, signaling the tree's death. The dry, dead needles presented a fire (2) hazard, my family had no choice but to chop it down. Although the tree was more than two hundred feet high—the tallest on my family's property—it was killed by a creature no bigger than my (3) fingertip, the bark beetle.

[1] The insect attacks trees by burrowing under the bark, (4) lay eggs, and introduce a fungus that halts the tree's sap production. [2] As a result, infected trees struggle to manage and transport their life-giving nutrients, and wooded areas with bark beetle infestations soon turn into graveyards of red and gray trees. [3] The mountain pine beetle, one of the many species of bark beetle, (5) spread through forests in droves, wreaking havoc on tree populations. [4] Causing further damage, (6) the tree's precious cambium layer is fed on by the freshly hatched beetle larvae. (7)

For decades, bark beetles have ravaged forests along the west side of North America, destroying millions of acres of trees from New Mexico all the way to Canada. People in these areas (8) have responded to the catastrophe by cutting down the dead trees, which they believe increase the risk of wildfires. Some (9) scientists however say otherwise. They point to evidence that shows that beetle infestations actually lower fire (10) danger. By causing pine trees to shed the needles that fuel forest fires.

While the insects (11) really mess up forests, they may not be the only ones to blame for the crisis. Foresters and researchers explain that other factors contribute to tree mortality, such as mild winters and periods of drought. (12) Nevertheless, one scientist, biologist Reese Halter, does not blame the beetle at all. Instead, he attributes the problem to climate change and global warming, which lead to shorter winters and drier summers. Faced with these harsh conditions, trees become weaker. The bark beetles, sensing the trees' weakness, zero in on their vulnerable targets. (13)

Question 12
Nevertheless,

G

On the other hand,

The correct answer is (H).

Effective transitional phrases are the lifeblood of a good essay. Learn to use them effectively, and the world will be your oyster. (We've never quite understood that phrase, both because it seems to discriminate against people with a shellfish allergy and because we think oysters are slimy and gross.) "In fact" is the right phrase here because it tells the reader that the sentence expands on the previous one with specific, relevant information.

To find the best transitional phrase, ask yourself how the two sentences relate to each other. They don't contrast with each other—as "nevertheless" (F) and "on the other hand" (J) imply—because not blaming the beetle is consistent with identifying "other factors." They don't have a cause-and-effect relationship (G), either: Halter, one of the "researchers" in the previous sentence, doesn't form his opinion as a "consequence" of his own viewpoint. That would be some pretty circular logic.

Question 13
The writer wants to add another sentence to the end of Paragraph 4. Given that each of the following sentences is true, which would best complete the paragraph?

A
Therefore, the bark beetle may actually be helping the environment by decreasing the likelihood of wildfires.

B
If I had only known about the climate factor, I would have watered my old pine tree every day of my life.

C
Still, even if the beetles are simply responding to a larger climate problem, their role in the destruction of trees is exacerbating an already dire situation.

D
Interestingly enough, the harmful fungus produced by the bark beetle stains the wood blue.

The correct answer is (C).

Time for some good ole' process of elimination. Fire risk (A), the topic of Paragraph 3, wouldn't fit in Paragraph 4, and returning to the first-person style of Paragraph 1 (B) would disrupt the serious tone of this paragraph. Finally, the tidbit about the blue fungus (D), as fascinating as it is, would be irrelevant in this paragraph. That leaves "Still, even if...", which builds nicely on the climate change issue and has enough finality to serve as a closing line. Wahoo!

Provide the scientific name for the ponderosa pine discussed in Paragraph 1.

Replace the anecdote in Paragraph 1 with a story about the bark beetle's influence on a particular town.

H
Rewrite all of the paragraphs so that they are in the first-person voice.

J
Include a section explaining the history of wildfires in North America.

The correct answer is (G).

While this question asks about a formal style, it's really all about finding the passage's informal parts and revising them. (Those tricky test-writers…) The best way to revise the passage according to formal guidelines is to scrap the personal, first-person anecdote and replace it with an objective one.

Adding unnecessary information doesn't make a passage more formal (F), (J), and putting the whole thing in first-person (H) makes the piece even more casual, brah.

Question 15
Suppose that the author wrote this passage to inform readers about the complexity of the bark beetle problem. Did the writer achieve this purpose?

A
Yes, because the passage explains the processes by which bark beetles attack trees.

B
Yes, because the passage balances the bark beetle's role with counterintuitive evidence.

C
No, because the passage focuses on the significance of the bark beetle in the writer's life.

D
No, because the passage presents only one perspective on the issue.

The correct answer is (B).

Even if it seems like a cinch that the answer is "Yes," take a look at the "No" options to be sure. The writer uses the first-person point of view only in the first paragraph and focuses on the larger significance of the bark beetle in the rest of the passage, so it's not too self-centered (C). Furthermore, the passage clearly explores multiple perspectives (D).

Okay, now we can choose between the two "Yes" options. The passage does explain how bark beetles attack trees (A), which may seem like a "complex" process—but explaining the process doesn't really inform readers about the greater complexity of the issue. Rather, the passage recognizes this complexity by first describing the harm caused by the beetle, then by exploring evidence that surprisingly shifts the blame away from the beetle (B). Now that's what we call a plot twist.

G

H

J

The correct answer is (J).

Snaps to the writer of this passage for the clever wordplay. The sentence leads the reader to believe that the passage will be talking about Hollywood stars like Julia Roberts or Viggo Mortensen (so dreamy) instead of celestial stars, but the phrase "and not the kind found on the silver screen" clears things right up. The em-dash helps to explain and emphasize this wordplay by isolating the final phrase.

Without punctuation, the sentence is rushed and confusing (F). Colons are used to introduce lists or some other relevant information, but a colon doesn't fit with this sort of about-face transition (G). While using a comma after "stars" isn't wrong, the bold em-dash is a better candidate for setting apart highly important info (H). After all, if the reader went into the next paragraph expecting celebrity news and gossip, he or she would be pretty disappointed.

C

D

The correct answer is (D).

Herein lies a comma splice, or two independent clauses joined only by a comma. Because the current line forms a run-on sentence, we need an answer that breaks up the clauses with a conjunction or another punctuation mark. Of the given choices, our best option is to separate these clauses into two separate sentences. Sure, they'll miss each other, but Adele or T-Swift should be able to get them through the breakup.

As is, the sentence is a run-on (A). "Because" (B) implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the nice view and "an escape," but those are two separate deals. Similarly, using "and" (C) makes it seem like the second clause gives additional information on the first, when it's really more of a contrast. Remember that the writer is essentially saying, "The observatory isn't just this; it's also that."

The correct answer is (H).

Don't be fooled. Even though a "community" is made up of more than one person, that doesn't make it a plural noun. In addition to being a former NBC sitcom with a cult following, "community" is a singular noun referring to a group of people. It describes their function rather than their number, so it remains singular and requires singular verbs and pronouns. 

Leaving the sentence as it is (F) joins a singular noun with a plural pronoun pair, so that's a no-go. "Gives they" (G) and "gives us" (J) keep it plural as well and use the wrong pronoun.

No, that isn't a typo. This guy's name is actually Griffith Griffith. In this sentence, Griffith's name serves as related information that expands on the independent clause, so use a colon to separate it from the main clause.

The sentence is talking about Griffith, not talking to him, so a colon is more appropriate than a comma (A). The semicolon (C) and lack of any punctuation (D) are flat-out grammatically incorrect, and that makes us twitch worse than the name "Griffith Griffith."

The correct answer is (F).

Trust us, filling in a few bubbles with a pencil or clicking away with a mouse for an hour or two is a much better way to spend an afternoon that swinging a pick axe in a mine somewhere. (Okay, so Griffith owned the mines and probably never got his hands dirty, but still.) This one is a little tricky because all of the answers are technically correct. However, the passage as it stands is the best option because it makes use of an idiom that fits the context perfectly. Get it? A miner "struck" it rich. They strike rocks during mining. Hilarious.

The other options don't fit with the style and context of this passage. "Acquired great wealth" is technically correct, but way too formal to match the passage's overall tone (H). "Became a prosperous businessman" is a bit redundant, putting "businessman" and "business" only a few words away from each other (G). "Got super rich" goes the other way, and is a bit too casual for the tone of the passage (J).

The correct answer is (C).

Picking the correct transition between two clauses isn't always easy and/or interesting, but think about it this way: The best chance anyone has of striking it rich these days is to get a good education. Because the two clauses in this sentence are sequential, the best transition is "and so," which implies cause and effect.

The clauses that the sentence transitions between don't contrast—as in "however" (A) and "yet" (D)—nor does the second point provide extra info (B).

Question 22
The writer is thinking about adding the following sentence to Paragraph 2:

"While on a tour of Europe, Griffith witnessed the splendor of the continent's public parks and returned with a new vision for his hometown in California."

In the paragraph, the writer should insert the sentence:

F
before Sentence 1.

G
before Sentence 2.

H
before Sentence 3.

J
OMIT

The correct answer is (H).

This paragraph already flows fairly well, but never let "good enough" be good enough. If there's another piece of information that will add significantly to the essay, put it in there, and let it earn its lunch. In this example, the additional sentence discusses how Griffith got the idea for creating public park spaces. It makes the most sense to put this sentence before Sentence 3 because it explains how Griffith went from making lots of money in the mining industry to using all that dough to create public parks.

Sentence 1 introduces Griffith; it wouldn't make much sense to talk about his European vacation before he'd even been introduced (F). Sentence 2 is about his career and success, which are critical details to understand before talking about his inspiration to create more parks (G). Average folks usually can't afford to donate millions to fund the opening of a new park and observatory.

The correct answer is (C).

What we're looking at here is four different attempts at an idiom, or a fixed expression with a figurative meaning. Idioms can be tricky because they vary from language to language, and some are more common than others. In this instance, the proper idiom is "not to mention," (C) which introduces an additional piece of information to reinforce an earlier point. The breathtaking panorama of L.A. is a bonus on top of telescope viewings and planetarium shows, so this idiom is a perfect fit.

If you can't quite remember how an idiom is worded, try plugging all the options back into the sentence to see which sounds the smoothest. Put back into the sentence, the other options sound (A) (B) (D) like an awkwardly-worded Mad Lib.

Question 24
Admiring all of the wonderful things

F
NO CHANGE

G
In admiration of all of the wonderful things

H
They admired all of the wonderful things

J
Admire all of the wonderful things

The correct answer is (J).

The previous sentences switch from a narrative style to something more akin to a series of commands. Rather than telling the reader about all of the wonders of the Griffith Observatory, the author instructs the reader on what to do should he or she ever visit. "Admire all of the wonderful things" may not seem like a complete sentence because there's no explicit subject. Because it is a command, however, the subject is an implied "you"—just as it is in the previous two sentences—so that's our answer.

Alarm bells should go off when you read "admiring" (F) and "in admiration of" (G) because they both create sentence fragments. While "they admired" (H) may seem like a good choice because it forms a complete sentence, it breaks away from the imperative construction of the previous sentences ("Watch" and "Spend") by referring to an ambiguous "They." Who are they, anyway?

It turns out that the old cliché has some truth. Less really is more—at least when it comes to wordy phrases like these. All of the extra words serve to make the sentence longer with no added benefit or information. Therefore, it's best to go with the shortest, most straightforward option.

Writing phrases like "which after it was finished would become" (C) wastes time and energy that could be better spent thinking of increasingly complex drink orders at Starbucks. Double tall, half-caf, non-fat, extra foam, vanilla-raspbery-hazelnut mocha latte, anyone? On second thought, perhaps we'll stick with black coffee.

The correct answer (J).

Each of these phrases seems grammatically correct until we consider the phrase that comes before it: "Inspired by a telescope viewing at Mount Wilson." Because the observatory is Griffith's "idea," he should remain that active "doer" in the sentence. He was the one who was "inspired" to give more money, and only one sentence gives credit where credit is due. 

It doesn't make sense to say that the city was inspired by the viewing (F), (G). It's even stranger to say that the money was inspired (H). Griffith is the one who's inspired, so he should be the subject of the sentence. Certainly, the guy may have a questionable history, but these are grammar rules we're talking about.

Question 27
The writer is revising the paragraph to make it fit the passage as a whole and is considering removing the following sentence:

 "However, the city officials accepted the money reluctantly, as Griffith had recently been released from prison for shooting his wife."

Given that the information is true, should the writer delete this sentence?

A
Yes, because the information is libelous and defamatory.

B
Yes, because the sentence detracts from the description of the observatory.

C
No, because the information presents a more balanced view of Griffith the man.

D
No, because the sentence makes the passage more interesting .

The correct answer is (B)

And here we thought this was a nice little story about a kind-hearted old rich guy who never hurt a fly and donated his money for the public good while all the woodland creates danced and sang a happy tune. Apparently, Griffith had some personal baggage. The passage, however, isn't really about Griffith's personal life. Including this little detail about attempted murder and prison time detracts from the real subject: the park and observatory. 

Even though this information spices up the story (D) and gives us a better idea of Griffith's character (C), the passage isn't about Griffith's dark history. The information might defame—or damage the reputation of—Griffith, but it's not libel because it's true (A). #lawyered

The correct answer is (G).

The bad news for Griffith: He didn't live to see the completed observatory. The good news for Griffith: He also didn't have to sort out the verbs in this question. 

Because it indicates that the "achieving"—the construction of the observatory—began before the observatory actually opened, the verb phrase must be in the past perfect tense, or "had finally been achieved." That makes sense, as it's tough to open a building before it's constructed. 

The verb shouldn't be in the present perfect tense (F) or the simple past tense (H) and (J).

Ah, the paragraph question. The routine for these should be pretty familiar by now: Sum up each paragraph and find the order that makes the most sense. Paragraph 1 describes the location of the observatory, Paragraph 2 introduces Griffith the man, Paragraph 3 explains what visitors can do at the observatory, and Paragraph 4 tells about Griffith's idea to build it in the first place.

The order of Paragraphs 1 and 2 is fine, because one sets the scene and the next explains how the observatory began. The order of Paragraphs 3 and 4, however, is reversed. It doesn't make sense to discuss current exhibits (Paragraph 3) between two paragraphs about the observatory's origins (Paragraphs 2 and 4). It would make much more sense to finish the origin story and then describe the exhibits, so the best order is 1, 2, 4, 3 (C).

Question 30
Judging by the tone and content of this passage, in which of the following publications would it most likely be published?

F
a magazine about Los Angeles culture

G
a national news website

H
an encyclopedia entry about observatories

J
a scholarly periodical for astronomers

The correct answer is (F).

Reading about how awesome this observatory is kind of makes us want to jump up and go see it for ourselves right now, and we're betting the author of this passage had something like that in mind when he/she wrote it. It makes perfect sense for a magazine about Los Angeles to discuss the history of a local landmark and recommend that the reader pay a visit.

An encyclopedia entry (H) or even a scholarly periodical (J) might provide information on the history of an observatory, but they generally don't offer travel tips—which is exactly what this passage does when it tells "you" to visit the observatory and "see it for yourself." While we're talking about the "you" voice, we can rule out a national news site (G), as a national news story would probably avoid addressing the reader directly. Also, there isn't much that would be considered newsworthy in the passage. The only juicy bit was the attempted murder, and that happened a long time ago. We're talking pre-Facebook long ago.

But the observatory offers more than a nice view of (17) Venus, it provides the community with an escape from the bustling city and (18) gives them access to the wonders of scientific discovery.

[1] The observatory began as the (19) dream of one man, Griffith Jenkins Griffith. [2] Born in Wales in 1850, Griffith immigrated to the United States as a teenager and started out as a journalist, but later (20) struck it rich in the mining business. [3] He believed it was his duty to use his wealth for the public good, (21) however, in 1896 Griffith donated over three-thousand acres of land to the city of Los Angeles for the creation of a "Great Park." (22) 

In the following decades, visitors would come to Griffith Observatory to experience telescope viewings and planetarium shows, (23) only to mention a breathtaking panorama of the Los Angeles cityscape. You can go and see it for yourself, free of charge. Watch the enormous Foucault Pendulum swing up and down in the Central Rotunda. Spend some time at the Gunther Depths of Space exhibit and find out how much you weigh on Jupiter. (24) Admiring all of the wonderful things that Griffith Observatory offers—or simply enjoy a picnic on the grass and soak up the sun.

As the city developed Griffith Park, (25) which was in the process of becoming one of the largest urban parks in the United States, Griffith had another idea. Inspired by a telescope viewing at Mount Wilson, (26) the city received an additional $100,000 from Griffith in 1912 to build an observatory atop Mount Hollywood. (27) However, the city officials accepted the money reluctantly, as Griffith had recently been released from prison for shooting his wife. The observatory opened on May 14, 1935, and even though Griffith was not alive to see it, his goal of bringing the magic of science to the public (28) has finally been achieved.

B

D

The correct answer is (D).

Vinyl has made a comeback, and we hear cassette tapes are the next cool retro thing to own, but will Morse code ever be trendy? We bet someone, somewhere is cooking up an app that will let Scrillex mix a few dots and dashes into his next track. At least that's what we think of when we hear "telegraph," but wait, there was something called the same thing before the electric one that we all know and love? Subverted expectations sounds a bit like a contrast, so we need a word to illustrate that. "Yet" correctly suggests that this ain't yo' great-grandma's telegraph; we're going back a few more generations than that. 

"Moreover" (A) indicates additional information, but we're looking for a contrast. "Thus" (B) and "hence" (C) describe a cause and effect relationship, which isn't quite right, either.

The Original Telegraph

When most people hear the word "telegraph," they think of electric cables and Morse code. (31) Moreover, before anyone sent messages via dots and dashes, the world (32) was already revolutionized by a communication system of the same name. In the 1790s, the French inventor Claude Chappe developed the optical telegraph (33) as a means of expediting military communication during the French Revolution. He named his device the "telegraph," and for a half century (34) the word refers only to Chappe's invention.

Also known as the semaphore telegraph, (35) the line of sight between stations arranged in a chain was relied on by the optical telegraph. Each station consisted of a tower with a wooden semaphore—(36) one long, rotatable beam with a moveable arm attached to each of the two ends. Telegraph operators transmitted messages by arranging the semaphore into one of (37) near two-hundred possible positions that corresponded to letters, numbers and words in a codebook. Operators at the adjacent station then used telescopes to mimic the position and convey the signal to the next tower.

[1] Messages that usually took weeks or months to send by horseback now took only minutes or hours to convey by telegraph. [2] The fifteen stations in the chain could transmit a single character from one city to the next in nine minutes and a complete message in less than an hour. [3] One of the first major optical telegraph lines, the Paris-Lille line, began operation in 1794 and spanned the 120-mile distance between the two French cities. [4] Although the new technology required (38) lots of patience, (39) they greatly reduced transmission time over long distances. (40)

[1] Despite its great impact, the original telegraph was short-lived. [2] Even as the method gained popularity in Europe, the electromagnetic telegraph began to eclipse (41) it's predecessor after the first electric line opened in 1844. [3] Unlike the optical telegraph, the electric telegraph did not rely on sight and could send messages (42) on any hour, at any weather conditions. [4] (43) In conclusion, in 1865 the first transatlantic electric line was established, enabling instantaneous communication between North America and Europe—an achievement beyond the capability of the optical telegraph.

Question 32

G
was already being

H

J

The correct answer is (H).

The passage is talking about something that started and ended in the past: the creation of the telegraph. In this scenario, we use the simple past tense. However, then there's a reference to something that happened before the invention of the dots-and-dashes telegraph: Claude Chappe's original telegraph. What tense do you use when you want to talk about something that happened in the past relative to something else in the past? The past perfect, which is formed by combining the word "had" with the past participle of the verb. In this sentence, that means "had" + "already been."

As is, the sentence is written is in the simple past (F). "Was already being" is something called the past progressive (G), and "has already been" (J) is the present perfect. None of these tenses are appropriate when talking about an event that happened further in the past than another event. Is it just us, or things starting to sound a bit Inception-y up in here?

Question 33
The writer wants to shorten this paragraph and is considering deleting the following phrase from the sentence:

"as a means of expediting military communication during the French Revolution."

If this portion were omitted, the paragraph would primarily lose:

A
information on how the optical telegraph worked.

B
an explanation of the original purpose of the optical telegraph.

C
a fact that gives the passage a charged political context.

D
a detail that differentiates the optical telegraph from the electric telegraph.

The correct answer is (B).

Back in the 1790s, military communication went slowly. There might've been some homing pigeons around, but that method of communication is for the birds (bazinga!). Officers in the field needed to communicate, so they started flashing lights at each other. Though it seems primitive now, this was quite the accomplishment back in the day. Without this crucial detail, the passage would lose an important piece of information about the original purpose of the optical telegraph.

Although the French Revolution was certainly an intense political movement, complete with government overthrow and beheadings, mentioning the revolution does not give the passage a charged political context (C), as the rest of the passage is apolitical. The passage describes how the optical telegraph worked (A) and differentiates it from the electric version (D), but the phrase in question does neither.

G

H

J

The correct answer is (H).

We are back to talking about the plain ole' past, not the past of the past, so we can drop the past perfect and just focus on the simple past here. "The word referred" is correct because it tells us that at some point in the past, "telegraph" meant something different than it does today. If it still meant that other thing, we'd use the past continuous tense, "has referred," to indicate an ongoing action, but telegraph stopped meaning optical telegraph a long time ago. 

It may seem like the answer should be "had referred" (J), but the past perfect verb construction is incorrect. Although the phrase "for a half century" suggests a future event in the past, this sentence addresses only one past—and the past perfect tense describes the past of the past. Do you have a headache yet?

The correct answer is (D).

This sentence sets off the "PASSIVE VOICE" alarms all over Shmoop Headquarters. "The line of sight" is the direct object of this sentence, not the subject, so it has no business coming before the verb and forcing the awkward phrasing, "was relied on by." If that wasn't enough of a tip-off, "also known as the semaphore telegraph" modifies "the optical telegraph," and all of the rules of grammar tell us that the modifier and thing it modifies should be as close to each other as possible. Only one option addresses both of those issues beautifully.

The correct answer is (F).

In cases like these, apply the old switcheroo: If the two adjectives—"long" and "rotatable"—can switch places and still make sense, insert a comma. Another trick is to substitute the word "and" for the comma. If things still make sense, then that comma is 100% necessary. Both methods narrow the options to either "one long, rotatable beam" (F) or "one long, rotatable beam," (H), and because placing a comma before the preposition "with" is unnecessary, the one-comma option is the winner, winner, chicken dinner.

Question 37
near two-hundred possible positions

A
NO CHANGE

B
near two-hundred possibly positions

C
nearly two-hundred possible positions

D
nearly two-hundred possibly positions

The correct answer is (C).

Fortunately, this question has only four possible answers—not two hundred. Once we figure out where the adjectives and adverbs need to go, we can cut that number down to one. In the first case, the adverb "nearly" is correct because it modifies the adjective "two-hundred." (Adverbs can also modify verbs and other adverbs.) In the second case, however, the adjective "possible" is correct because it modifies the noun "positions." Therefore, there couldn't possibly be any possible answer other than "nearly two-hundred possible positions." Okay, that was redundant, but it helped us make our point.

As is, the sentence sounds like old-timer slang (A). The phrase "possibly positions," we hope, doesn't pass anyone's ear test (B), (D).

"They" is a plural pronoun, so it must refer to a plural subject. However, the subject of the sentence is "The new technology," a singular noun. That means we need a singular pronoun, like "it." 

Right away we can rule out the plural pronouns "they" (A) and "all" (D). We can forget about "each" (B) as well, because it implies a single unit of a plural entity. Then we have the answer, and that's it. (Literally. "It" is the answer.)

Sentence 1 expands on this idea by giving specific information about the telegraph's speed, so it should come next. Then comes Sentence 3, which provides an example of the telegraph's speed. Finally, Sentence 2 closes the paragraph by presenting some details about the Paris-Lille line or "chain." Look at that—we figured that one out in a lot less time than it takes to operate an optical telegraph.

The Original Telegraph

When most people hear the word "telegraph," they think of electric cables and Morse code. (31) Moreover, before anyone sent messages via dots and dashes, the world (32) was already revolutionized by a communication system of the same name. In the 1790s, the French inventor Claude Chappe developed the optical telegraph (33) as a means of expediting military communication during the French Revolution. He named his device the "telegraph," and for a half century (34) the word refers only to Chappe's invention.

Also known as the semaphore telegraph, (35) the line of sight between stations arranged in a chain was relied on by the optical telegraph. Each station consisted of a tower with a wooden semaphore—(36) one long, rotatable beam with a moveable arm attached to each of the two ends. Telegraph operators transmitted messages by arranging the semaphore into one of (37) near two-hundred possible positions that corresponded to letters, numbers and words in a codebook. Operators at the adjacent station then used telescopes to mimic the position and convey the signal to the next tower.

[1] Messages that usually took weeks or months to send by horseback now took only minutes or hours to convey by telegraph. [2] The fifteen stations in the chain could transmit a single character from one city to the next in nine minutes and a complete message in less than an hour. [3] One of the first major optical telegraph lines, the Paris-Lille line, began operation in 1794 and spanned the 120-mile distance between the two French cities. [4] Although the new technology required (38) lots of patience, (39) they greatly reduced transmission time over long distances. (40)

[1] Despite its great impact, the original telegraph was short-lived. [2] Even as the method gained popularity in Europe, the electromagnetic telegraph began to eclipse (41) it's predecessor after the first electric line opened in 1844. [3] Unlike the optical telegraph, the electric telegraph did not rely on sight and could send messages (42) on any hour, at any weather conditions. [4] (43) In conclusion, in 1865 the first transatlantic electric line was established, enabling instantaneous communication between North America and Europe—an achievement beyond the capability of the optical telegraph.

Question 41
it's

A
NO CHANGE

B
its'

C
its

D
it is

The correct answer is (C).

We're on to your tricks, it's. Your apostrophe makes you look possessive, but really, you're a contraction. We've had enough of you tripping up Shmoopers left and right, however, so we're finally letting the secret out.

"Its" is the gender neutral equivalent of "his" and "hers," two other possessives that never use an apostrophe. Seriously, how awkward would "hi's" look? Because this sentence needs the possessive pronoun rather than the contraction for "it is," the answer is "its."

The contraction "it's" makes the phrase read, "the electromagnetic telegraph began to eclipse it is predecessor (A), (D). "Its'" is the plural possessive, though we are finding it difficult to imagine a scenario where that would even be necessary (B).

Question 42
on any hour, at any weather conditions

F
NO CHANGE

G
in any hour, for any weather conditions

H
at any hour, under any weather conditions

J
with any hour, after any weather conditions

The correct answer is (H).

This question has us getting up close and personal with prepositions. Though each answer choice has the same gist, only one is correct. We recommend trying out some other sentences referring to time and circumstances and see what comes naturally. For example, "Papa Shmoop will start banjo practice at five o' clock" and "Mama Shmoop will sing opera music under any conditions." Seeing a pattern here? (And no, the pattern is not that the aria from Don Giovanni sounds amazing accompanied by a banjo.)

If picking the right prepositions doesn't come naturally, try eliminating the other answer choices. When was the last time you were in an hour? Unless you found yourself trapped in an hourglass lately, the answer is probably "never" (F), (G). Unlike the Spice Girls' friends, you also never get "with" an hour (J).

In conclusion,

B
Furthermore,

C
Conversely,

D
Although,

The correct answer is (B).

It's time to talk about relationships—and no, not the awkward kind. We need to identify the relationship between this sentence and the one before it. Both sentences expand on the same idea, and the second sentence simply gives additional information. That type of transition, when one thought leads directly into another thought without any contrast or causal relationship, is best indicated the word "Furthermore."

The sentence doesn't complete a cause and effect relationship or tell what happens as a result of something else (A). Neither does the second sentence contrast with the first one, as in "conversely" (C) and "although" (D), because both sentences discuss different reasons why the electric telegraph is superior to the optical telegraph.

Question 44
The writer is considering adding the following sentence to Paragraph 4:

"For example, the last optical telegraph line in France was shut down in 1853, because it was unable to compete with the benefits of the new system."

Where in the paragraph should the writer place the sentence?

F

G

H

J

The correct answer is (G).

This shiny new sentence provides a specific example in which the new telegraph replaced the old one. The sentence that makes a general statement about the new "eclipsing" the old is Sentence 2. Because the new sentence expands on this idea with specific information, it should come right after Sentence 2.

After Sentence 1 (F) wouldn't work because the sentence would provide an example for something that hasn't even been stated yet. After Sentence 3 (H) would be confusing as sentence three is an explanation of some of the benefits of the electric telegraph. The new sentence introduces the idea of these benefits, so it definitely has to come before any of them are listed. Sentence 4 (J) is the conclusion of the paragraph and of the entire passage. The new sentence is shiny and special and all that, but it isn't a conclusion.

Question 45
Suppose the writer intended to explain the impact of the optical telegraph on international relations in Europe. Does the writer attain this goal in the passage as a whole?

A
Yes, because the writer elaborates on the telegraph's influence during the French Revolution.

B
Yes, because the writer discusses how neighboring countries integrated their telegraph networks with each other.

C
No, because the writer spends most of the passage comparing the optical telegraph and the electric telegraph.

D
No, because the writer only focuses on the way the telegraph transformed communication.

The correct answer is (D).

Before reading this passage, many readers probably weren't even aware that there was such a thing as the optical telegraph. The author knew this, so he or she focused on the details of the actual communications systems and how communications themselves changed rather than talking much about their impact on the world. 

The writer refers to the French Revolution only in passing but doesn't discuss the telegraph's role in it (A). Neither does the writer talk about international networks (B). European countries rarely integrated optical telegraph lines with their neighbors, anyway—so this isn't even true. While the writer does compare the two kinds of telegraphs (C), most of the passage is about the importance of the optical telegraph and not the electric telegraph.

The correct answer is (J).

The introductory phrase in question modifies "sandwich," so "intrigued in" (F) and "intrigued by" (G) would imply that the sandwich is the one being intrigued by something else, not the one being intriguing to other people. "Intriguing" (H) is missing the necessary preposition "in" to make it fit with the text that follows it in the passage ("both flavor and variety"). "Intriguing in" (J) is the only option to properly indicate that the sandwich is the one being intriguing to people and fit with the rest of the sentence.

Passage A
(46) Intrigued in both flavor and history, the Vietnamese baguette sandwich, also known as banh mi, has developed a loyal American following in recent years. (47) Yet, banh mi arrived in the United States much earlier than that, and (48) it's origins are intertwined with European colonialism in Southeast Asia. As a result, banh mi combines culinary traditions from several different cultures, truly (49) becoming the idea of fusion food.

(50) Banh mi first appeared in Vietnam as a Parisian baguette sandwich. This consisted simply of a buttered baguette, occasionally topped with ham or pâté (a kind of spreadable meat topping). (51) Although, banh mi evolved to include the local Vietnamese ingredients that many banh mi stores advertise today as the "Special Combination." This version of banh mi consists of a toasted baguette, cilantro leaves, thinly sliced chili peppers, and sweet pickled carrot and daikon (a type of white radish), in addition to Vietnamese cold cuts and pâté.

Banh mi came to the United States in the (52) 1960's and 1970's, when Vietnamese families (53) fled from the Vietnam War. (54) Although traditional Vietnamese ingredients weren't always available, banh mi in the United States included whatever enterprising sandwich-makers had on hand—even, at times, Miracle Whip. Only a decade later, banh mi had become one of the most popular dishes in the Vietnamese-American community. (55) Selling six-inch sandwiches for only a dollar or two apiece in Southern California's Little Saigon, located in the cities of Westminster and Orange, banh mi shops would engage in price wars. (56)

Today, banh mi continues to evolve, although the basic structure of the sandwich remains the same. Other common Vietnamese ingredients include barbecued pork, tofu, and crunchy pork skin. (57) Even if banh mi is topped with Polish sausage, curry, French peppered steak, or other ingredients (58) as yet unknown, the combination (59) demonstrates a mixing of (60) flavors—and of cultures.

"However" is the only option that correctly conveys contrast and that is allowable at the beginning of a sentence.

"Nevertheless" (C) implies that the earlier arrival occurred despite the banh mi's recent popularity. "Thus" (D) is incorrect because it signals that the earlier arrival of banh mi was caused by its recent popularity. Although "yet" (A) accurately contrasts the recent popularity with the earlier arrival, it's a subordinating conjunction that doesn't work at the beginning of a sentence.

G

H

The correct answer is (H).

Homophone alert. This sentence is referring to the possessive version of "its," which we know because something belongs to it ("origins"). The correct possessive form of the pronoun "it" is "its," without any apostrophe whatsoever.

Using the contraction "it's" (F) is incorrect because it would mean we're saying "it is origins," which is missing a certain something...like semantic sense. Moving the apostrophe around to a different spot doesn't help matters, and it certainly doesn't give us the possessive version of "it" that we need (G). Since we're referring to the origins of the banh mi in the singular, it also wouldn't make sense to talk about "their" origins (J).

B
embodying the idea

C
replacing the idea

D
understanding the idea

The correct answer is (B).

In the context of the sentence, the sandwich is representing the idea of fusion food, and "embodying" means representing something in tangible form (B).

The phrase "becoming the idea" (A) suggests that the sandwich morphs into an idea of fusion food, which is inaccurate, even though it does eventually disappear into someone's stomach. Saying that the banh mi replaces the idea of fusion food implies that the sandwich and the idea of fusion food are mutually exclusive, which they aren't (C). "Understanding the idea" makes it seem like banh mi is alive and able to understand things (D). Finding out that your sandwich is alive would be a horrible surprise for most people, not to mention the fact that the sandwich would probably hold a grudge against you for planning to eat it.

Question 50
The author wants to add another sentence to the beginning of this paragraph. Given that they are all true, which of the following choices would best fit?

F
Vietnam was a French colony from the late nineteenth century until the middle of the twentieth century.

G
Vietnamese chefs often worked for French households, becoming proficient in French cuisine.

H
European involvement in Southeast Asia dates back to the middle of the nineteenth century.

J
Vietnam is known for its innovative cuisine and fresh ingredients.

The correct answer is (F).

The first paragraph introduced the idea that the origins of banh mi are related to European colonialism, and the body of the second paragraph discusses how banh mi combines elements from different cultures. The information that's missing, however, is why in the world Vietnamese food shows a French influence. The option that explains that Vietnam was formerly a French colony is the appropriate transition to introduce the reason why a Parisian sandwich might be found in Vietnam.

Although likely true, discussing the nuances of how Vietnamese chefs interacted with French households during colonial times would be too specific (G). On the other hand, bringing up colonialism in general, rather than specifying France, is too broad (H). In a similar fashion, it's also too broad to say that Vietnamese cuisine has always been innovative (J). That avoids the connection to a specific colonial power entirely, and we won't find the answer by avoiding the issue and sticking our heads in the sand like ostriches.

As a result, banh mi combines culinary traditions from several different cultures, truly (49) becoming the idea of fusion food.

(50) Banh mi first appeared in Vietnam as a Parisian baguette sandwich. This consisted simply of a buttered baguette, occasionally topped with ham or pâté (a kind of spreadable meat topping).

This version of banh mi consists of a toasted baguette, cilantro leaves, thinly sliced chili peppers, and sweet pickled carrot and daikon (a type of white radish), in addition to Vietnamese cold cuts and pâté.

Banh mi came to the United States in the (52) 1960's and 1970's, when Vietnamese families (53) fled from the Vietnam War. (54) Although traditional Vietnamese ingredients weren't always available, banh mi in the United States included whatever enterprising sandwich-makers had on hand—even, at times, Miracle Whip.

B

C

D

The correct answer is (D).

The key word "evolved" communicates the ideas that the changes took place slowly over time, so the best and most corresponding adverb is "eventually."

"Although" doesn't work because it sets up a contrast, and it also creates a dangling, lonely dependent clause (A). "Inevitably" (B) is incorrect because there's no evidence to show it was completely certain that Vietnamese ingredients would be used in the sandwiches. "Surprisingly" (C) doesn't work because it's also not surprising that these traditional Vietnamese ingredients were used. The sandwiches were being made in Vietnam, after all.

The correct answer is (H).

Years as decades (the sixties and the seventies) don't require apostrophes. Just an "s" on the end of each is all we need.

Using an apostrophe makes the years possessive (F). Moving the apostrophe to after the "s" doesn't do anything but make a bad situation worse (G). Leaving off both the apostrophes and the "s" makes the dates refer only to the two separate years of 1960 and 1970, instead of the decades (J). Why settle for two years when we could have two entire decades?

A

B

C

D

The correct answer is (A).

The phrase "fled from the Vietnam War" correctly implies that people were escaping from Vietnam to other, safer areas. The paragraph explains that they left Vietnam to come to the United States, so "from" is the right direction.

It doesn't make sense to talk about fleeing "in" (C) or "of" (D) a war because the idea of feeling necessarily implies some sort of direction. "Fled away from" may seem correct at first, but the word "away" is extraneous (B).

The correct answer is (H).

"Because" correctly describes the relationship between the lack of traditional Vietnamese ingredients and the modified banh mi in the United States. They used different ingredients because others weren't available, and enterprising sandwich makers had to look elsewhere. (Miracle Whip, anyone? Vegenaise? Nutella?)

"Although" (F) incorrectly describes the relationship as one of contrast, and "therefore" (G) makes it sound like using different ingredients caused the usual ones to become unavailable. "In fact" (J) doesn't establish a relationship at all, since "in fact" usually clarifies or adds to a previous statement.

Question 55
Selling six-inch sandwiches for only a dollar or two apiece in Southern California’s Little Saigon, located in the cities of Westminster and Orange, banh mi shops would engage in price wars.

A
NO CHANGE

B
Located in the cities of Westminster and Orange, in Southern California's Little Saigon, banh mi shops would engage in price wars, selling six-inch sandwiches for only a dollar or two apiece.

C
Banh mi shops would engage in price wars in Southern California's Little Saigon, located in the cities of Westminster and Orange, selling sandwiches for only a dollar or two apiece.

D
In Southern California's Little Saigon, located in the cities of Westminster and Orange County, banh mi shops would engage in price wars, selling six-inch sandwiches for only a dollar or two apiece.

The correct answer is (D).

Modifiers should be placed as close as possible to the subject being modified. "Located in the cities of Westminster and Orange" modifies Little Saigon, and "selling six-inch sandwiches for only a dollar or two apiece" modifies the banh mi shops. The best option available is to start with the introductory prepositional phrase about Little Saigon, then give its location, then state the subject and verb of the sentence (shops would engage), and finally, add the phrase describing how the price wars worked.

It's a grammatically bad idea to separate the descriptive phrase about price wars from "bahn mi shops," the phrase it modifies (A), (C). These items really want to stick together. It also doesn't make sense to say "Located in the cities of Westminster and Orange, in Southern California's Little Saigon," because that makes it sound like the cities of Westminster and Orange are located inside Little Saigon (B).

Question 56
The writer is considering adding the following true statement to Paragraph 4:

Moreover, banh mi makers have begun to look to other culinary traditions for ingredients and inspiration, just like their precursors did decades ago.

Given the topic of Paragraph 4, this sentence would most logically fit:

F
OMIT

G
before Sentence 1.

H
before Sentence 2.

J
before Sentence 3.

The correct answer is (J).

Because this statement introduces the idea that banh mi has begun to borrow from even more cultural traditions, it makes the most sense to place it before Sentence 3 (the one giving examples of those new and foreign influences). It serves as a transition from traditional ingredients to culturally diverse ingredients, such as curry and Polish sausage. Separately, that is. If you decide to combine curry and Polish sausage, we're not taking the blame.

"Moreover" signals that this sentence builds on a previous statement, so it doesn't belong at the beginning of the paragraph (G). Sentence 2 describes common Vietnamese ingredients, not ingredients from other cultural traditions, so this addition wouldn't be a good introduction to that sentence (H). Omitting the sentence completely would leave a clunky transition between the second and third sentences (F).

The correct answer is (B).

"Whether" encompasses the wide variety of ingredients that banh mi might include and implies that regardless of what that variety includes, it embodies fusion cuisine.

Using "even if" implies that banh mi is fusion cuisine despite its variety of ingredients (A). "Since" (C) and "due to the fact that" (D) limit the relationship to cause and effect, but that doesn't fit the overall idea of "Who cares what you put on that delicious, little sandwich?"

The correct answer is (J).

The context of the sentence implies that we're talking about ingredients that haven't been tried on a banh mi yet, but likely will be at some point in the future, which makes "yet to be experimented with" the most logical choice.

Leaving it as-is (F) and "as yet undiscovered" (H) both imply that some ingredients haven't yet been discovered at all, like alien potatoes. That doesn't seem likely. It's also rude to make assumptions about chefs and what they may or may not be hiding from us (G). Based on our experience, we shouldn't go that route unless we want a frying pan to the noggin.

This passage doesn't hold back, does it? It hits the reader with a complicated question right from the get-go, but because the question deals with context, make sure to read on before choosing an answer. Even though the sentence expands on the previous one, the new details are not "extraneous" (irrelevant and unnecessary) because they create a vivid image that helps the reader understand why the photo is mistakenly associated with the garbage patch.

The following paragraph explains how people confuse this photo from Manila with the "garbage patch" (A), and this sentence has nothing to do with ocean currents (D). The new sentence isn't a repeating any old info, either (C). 

Passage A
Passage V

The Great Pacific Garbage Patch

Circulating on the internet is a photo of a man paddling his canoe through vast swaths of floating garbage. (61) He is surrounded by so many plastic bags, cups and containers that the water is barely visible. In many cases, the photo (62) is found with news stories and blog posts about the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch," an enormous concentration of plastic pollution trapped by large-scale ocean currents. However, there is one big problem with the photo: It is a lie.

The photo, which actually comes from Manila Harbor in the Philippines, is just one of the many misrepresentations (63) that will lead people to believe that there was an island of trash floating in the middle of the ocean. (64) As a matter of fact, the garbage patch consists of tons of flecks of broken-down debris, many of which are microscopic. The accumulation of garbage (65) is referred to as a "patch" because the only plastic bits are grouped together by the North Pacific Gyre—a huge, circulating region of ocean that stretches from Japan to California—not because they form one large mass.

(66) Despite the misconceptions, the garbage patch is still a (67) dreadful real problem. While studies have shown that birds and fish often eat the plastic that constitutes most of the (68) garbage patch. There is little evidence that doing so actually kills them. Of greater concern (69) is the animals lower on the food chain that live or lay their eggs on the surface of the plastic. These creatures do not suffer from the pollution but thrive on it, (70) resulting in increased competition for food and disruptions in their local ecosystems.

[1] Furthermore, combing the ocean for debris would likely result in the destruction of the microscopic creatures that live in polluted areas. [2] Not only are the plastic pieces very small, their concentrations also span (71) hundreds, even thousands of squares miles and constantly change locations. [3] The obvious answer to the problem is to clean up the (72) ocean, this is harder than it seems. [4] These dismal realities lead many environmentalists to focus on ways to prevent the plastic from getting to the ocean in the first place. (73)

A

B

The correct answer is (B).

Before diving into the jumble of verbs in this question, let's think about the tense of all the verbs that come before it. They are all present tense. Unless there's a good reason to do otherwise, the verbs in this sentence should stay in the present tense. "Lead" is plural, present tense, and agrees with the subject ("misrepresentations") in number as well. 

"Lead" (A) keeps things in the future tense, and "led" (C) puts things in the past tense. We can rule out "leads" because it's singular (D), and the subject of the clause, "misrepresentations," is plural. Think of sentences like Thanksgiving dinners: They're much more pleasant when everyone agrees and gets along.

C

The correct answer is (D).

This question deals with misplaced modifiers, which are kind of like lost TV remotes. It's our job to pull the adverb in this sentence, "only," out of the metaphorical couch cushion and put it back on the coffee table where it belongs. The sentence points out that the accumulation is only referred to as a patch because of the North Pacific Gyre. "Is is only referred to as a..." is the only option that expresses this idea without creating awkward phrasing or changing the meaning.

We don't want the "only" modifying "plastic bits" (A) or "patch" (B). Putting the "only" in the middle of the verb phrase "referred to" is known as splitting the infinitive, and it is something all good writers avoid (C).

The dependent clause in question is a transitional phrase, which means we've got to figure out some relationships. The word "still" sets up a contrast by suggesting that the patch is a problem regardless of something else. Another word for "regardless" is "despite," which happens to be one of our options. 

"Because" makes it seem like the misconceptions are what are causing the problem, but there is no causal link between the two (G). "In addition to" (H) and "Considering all" (J) are more about about adding to the main point rather than showing a contrast.

C

D

The correct answer is (C).

To adverb, or not to adverb—that is the question. Remember that adverbs modify adjectives, verbs, and other adverbs, while adjectives modify only nouns. Because "problem" is a noun, we need the adjective "real," and "dreadfully" correctly modifies the adjective-noun pair, "real problem." We guess this question wasn't a real problem after all. (Eh? eh?)

Leaving the sentence with two adjectives would only work if there was a comma or an "and" between them (A). "Really" is an adverb, and adverbs can't modify nouns (B), (D). Only adjectives can do that.

One word to rule them all… Okay, so maybe that's a bit dramatic, but a single word can be quite powerful. In this sentence, the word "While" takes a complete thought ("studies have shown…") and turns it into a dependent clause, which by itself is a fragment. It needs an independent clause ("there is little evidence…") to form a complete sentence, and we join the two with none other than—my precious!—a comma.

The other options allow both clauses to be independent, and there's no way that the first half of the sentence can stand on its own. It needs that independent clause to complete its journey, much like how Frodo needed Sam to complete his journey to Mount Doom.

The trick with this question is that the usual subject-verb-object syntax is inverted, which means that we get our object first and our subject last. Flip them around and say it to yourself: "The animals (subject) are (verb) of greater concern (object)." Because the word "animals" is plural, the verb must also be plural. If this is confusing, try looking at the question while standing on your head. It won't help of course, but it'd be cool if you can do it.

The answer can't be "was" (C) or "were" (D), because they are both past tense and the rest of the passage is in the present tense. "Is" (A) won't work because the verb is singular in agreement with the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

If the writer were to remove this portion, the paragraph would primarily lose:

F
information that explains why the creatures' flourishing is harmful.

G

H

The writer probably shouldn't remove this bit after all, because it seems pretty important. After all, who knew that garbage could actually help certain little critters thrive? 

The underlined portion doesn't say anything about different kinds of wildlife (H), nor does it discuss any solutions (J). That comes in the next paragraph. It also doesn't show how pollutants harm animals' digestive systems (G); the beginning of the paragraph actually states that there's little evidence to support that claim. Instead, the underlined portion clarifies why "thriving" is a bad thing by mentioning the negative effects that overpopulation has on the environment.

Question 72
ocean, this

F
NO CHANGE

G
ocean this

H
ocean, but this

J
ocean, and this

The correct answer is (H).

Forget about cleaning up the ocean for now—let's just clean up this run-on sentence. "Ocean, but this" makes the most sense because the two independent clauses contradict each other, and the conjunction "but" points out that contrast nicely. If only cleaning the ocean were this easy.

Be sure not to jam the two independent clauses together with a comma splice (F), or without any punctuation at all (G).

The Great Pacific Garbage Patch

Circulating on the internet is a photo of a man paddling his canoe through vast swaths of floating garbage. (61) He is surrounded by so many plastic bags, cups and containers that the water is barely visible. In many cases, the photo (62) is found with news stories and blog posts about the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch," an enormous concentration of plastic pollution trapped by large-scale ocean currents. However, there is one big problem with the photo: It is a lie.

The photo, which actually comes from Manila Harbor in the Philippines, is just one of the many misrepresentations (63) that will lead people to believe that there was an island of trash floating in the middle of the ocean. (64) As a matter of fact, the garbage patch consists of tons of flecks of broken-down debris, many of which are microscopic. The accumulation of garbage (65) is referred to as a "patch" because the only plastic bits are grouped together by the North Pacific Gyre—a huge, circulating region of ocean that stretches from Japan to California—not because they form one large mass.

(66) Despite the misconceptions, the garbage patch is still a (67) dreadful real problem. While studies have shown that birds and fish often eat the plastic that constitutes most of the (68) garbage patch. There is little evidence that doing so actually kills them. Of greater concern (69) is the animals lower on the food chain that live or lay their eggs on the surface of the plastic.

Question 73
Consider the order of the sentences in Paragraph 4. Which of these sentence orders organizes the paragraph most logically?

A
NO CHANGE

B
3, 2, 1, 4

C
2, 4, 3, 1

D
4, 1, 3, 2

The correct answer is (B).

The garbage patch problem may seem dismal, but this question doesn't have to be. The key is the transition words. Sentence 3 opens the paragraph nicely with a general statement about the "answer to the problem." Then Sentence 2 gives an example of how cleaning the oceans is "harder than it seems." The word "Furthermore" in Sentence 1 signals that the sentence expands on the clean-up issue, which suggests that this sentence should come next. Finishing the paragraph, Sentence 4 refers back to the previous examples by using the phrase "These dismal realities," then closes the passage by suggesting another solution.

Question 74
Suppose the author's goal had been to inform readers about ways to clean up the "garbage patch." Does the author accomplish this goal in the passage as a whole?

F
Yes, because the author provides vivd details about the magnitude of the garbage patch to express the urgent need for its cleanup.

G
Yes, because the author provides a call to action urging readers to clean up the garbage patch.

H
No, because the author does not explain how the garbage patch is harmful to the ecosystem. 

J
No, because the author's call to action is too vague and doesn't provide specific examples of how to clean up the garbage patch.

The correct answer is (J).

If you've ever walked into a store with the intent to purchase one thing, but you got caught up looking at a bunch of other cool things and then walked out without the thing you actually wanted to buy in the first place, you and this author have a lot in common. This is a great article, but if the author wanted to explain ways to clean up the "garbage patch," they just didn't provide a lot of (or really any) specific suggestions on how to actually do that (J).  

When you're asked to evaluate whether or not the writer accomplished a particular goal, be sure you not only have the correct "yes or no" answer, but the correct reasoning as well. The writer actually does provide information about how the garbage patch damages the ecosystem (H), so that's not why they miss the mark here. They also go into great details about the size and makeup of the "garbage patch" (F), but those details alone don't provide information about how to clean it up. While the author does say that cleaning the oceans is the most obvious solution (G), that's pretty weak as far as "calls to action" go.

Question 75
The writer is an eminent marine biologist who wants to inform the general public about the "Garbage Patch." In order to communicate this message more effectively, what stylistic changes should the writer make?

A
Add more technical biology terms.

B
Clearly explain what ecosystems are and how the pollution affects them.

C
Remove descriptions of terms such as "North Pacific Gyre."

D
Use slangs words such as "whack" to describe ocean pollution.

The correct answer is (B).

As it stands, the passage is less "call to action" and more "encyclopedia entry." There's nothing wrong with being informative, but with the danger posed by the garbage patch, it makes sense to throw in a few more meaty details. Eminent marine biologists have all sorts of wonderful details about the ocean crammed into their heads, but the information that will help this article the most is a clear explanation of what ecosystems are and how pollution affects them.

To appeal to the general public, the writer should avoid using jargon that only biologists would understand (A). By the same token, deleting descriptions of unfamiliar terms would limit the average reader's understanding of the topic (C). The writer should also be careful not to be too informal, which means that "whack" would be a totally bogus choice (D). Heads up: "totally bogus" is also too informal, but we're all friends here, right?
